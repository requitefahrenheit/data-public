ll love it and probably want to see it twice .	1
re in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish	1
s a talking head documentary , but a great one .	1
s a very entertaining , thought provoking film with a simple message	1
s an interesting effort   particularly for JFK conspiracy nuts  	1
s as hard to classify as it is hard to resist	1
s certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community .	1
s lots of cool stuff packed into ESPN  s Ultimate X.	1
s sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong	1
s so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller	1
s sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels	1
 A   devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid Holocaust drama .	1
 Reaches   wholly believable and heart wrenching depths of despair .	1
 Sports   admirable energy , full bodied characterizations and narrative urgency	1
 Woo  s   most resonant film since The Killer .	1
 faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty	1
,    Derrida is an undeniably fascinating and playful fellow .	1
, Big Trouble could be considered a funny little film .	1
, Like Mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud	1
, Notorious C.H.O. hits all the verbal marks it should .	1
, Thirteen Conversations About One Thing is a small gem .	1
,   Scratch   is a pretty decent little documentary .	1
, but it works under the direction of Kevin Reynolds .	1
, it  s goofy   if not entirely wholesome   fun	1
, really , really good things can come in enormous packages	1
, still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema	1
, the film operates nicely off the element of surprise ,	1
, the production works more often than it does n t .	1
, the trip there is a great deal of fun .	1
, then look no further , because here it is .	1
, this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate .	1
, to find a place among the studio  s animated classics	1
, very well told with an appropriate minimum of means .	1
, with some real shocks in store for unwary viewers .	1
... begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully .	1
