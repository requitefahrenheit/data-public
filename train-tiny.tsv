Hello I am from Denmark, and one day i was having a film evening with my friends. One brought this movie with him  Russian terminator  and it was extremely awful. After watching less than half a minute we decided to fast forward only stopping at some laughable  highlights  or should i say  lowlights  in the movie. I was actually mostly surprised to find out that this film was produced here in my homeland Denmark...that must have been the biggest mistake this country ever made.	0

Do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the Baby Boomer generation  Technically, I am a Boomer, though at the time when all the  idealistic youths  of the  60s were reading Marx, burning their draft cards, and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives  I was still in grade school. But I remember them well, and 9 out of 10 were just moronic fools, who would believe anything as long as it was destructive. This is just another excercise in self importance from the kids who never really grew up.	0

I think scarecrows are creepy, so it s a pity this movie doesn t make more of them. A bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows. One of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows. The acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive  when they move . On the positive side, the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows. It is as Alfred Hitchcock says,  A bomb under a table goes off, and that s surprise. We know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off, and that s suspense. 	0

When anti bush jokes get really easy to do, a show like this had better make sure it has something extra. When that something extra is kid versions of political figures making jokes about the future they don t have yet, it s just plain nonsense. Dick Cheney and George Bush are done well but Dick Cheney mutters mostly. There s also Condoleeza Rice who has a crush on Bush for some reason and Donald Rumsfeld who isn t really that similar to Donald Rumsfeld at all. The democratic characters rarely give their names so it s a mystery as to who could be who aside from Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton. The episodes have coherent stories but that s not nearly enough to keep this from sinking.	0

This has the absolute worst performance from Robert Duval who sounds just like William Buckley throughout the entire film. His hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest. I m not sure if this was deliberate scene stealing or inadvertent but it s the only thing I can recall from a truly forgettable film. This picture should be shown in every amateur acting class of an example of what not to do. Thank God, Duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to effect a cultured accent. He is a good character actor but that s about it. Klaus is so much better. His performance is muted and noteworthy.	0

Telemental Health is the use of telecommunications technology to provide mental health services to individuals in communities or locations that are underserviced. Under service is typically a result of geographic isolation. Examples of telemental health services include providing health workers in remote areas with continuing education on mental health topics, videoconferened consultations on routine and urgent mental health cases using a  virtual  case management team, and providing direct mental health care services through two way interactive systems. One of the most controversial telemental health care applications is providing treatment services over the Internet directly which, while showing early promise, will likely require considerable development to be made practical.	2

In New Zealand in the 1930s, farmers had trouble with exploding trousers as a result of attempts to wipe out the weed ragwort. Farmers had been spraying sodium chlorate, a government recommended weedkiller, onto the ragwort, and some of the spray had ended up on their clothes. Sodium chlorate is a strong oxidizing agent, and reacted with the organic fibres  i.e. the wool and the cotton  of the clothes. Reports had farmers  trousers variously smouldering and bursting into flame, particularly when exposed to heat or naked flames. One report had trousers that were hanging on a washing line starting to smoke.	2
Subjectivism is a philosophical tenet that accords primacy to subjective experiences as fundament of all measure and law. In an extreme form, it may hold that the nature and existence of every object depends only on someone s subjective awareness of it. For example, Wittgenstein wrote in Tractatus Logico Philosophicus   The subject doesn t belong to the world, but it is a limit of the world   proposition 5.632 . One may also consider the qualified empiricism of George Berkeley in this context, given his reliance on God as the prime mover of human perception.	2

Sure, this one isn t really a blockbuster, nor does it target such a position.  Dieter  is the first name of a quite popular German musician, who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and thats exactly what this movie is about. It is based on the autobiography  Dieter Bohlen  wrote a few years ago but isn t meant to be accurate on that. The movie is filled with some sexual offensive content  at least for American standard  which is either amusing  not for the other  actors  of course  or dumb   it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a  Bohlen  Fan or not. Technically speaking there isn t much to criticize. Speaking of me I find this movie to be an OK movie.	0

I liked many points of the movie, some of the quotes really cheered me up, but the stereotyped characters are present again, like in every Hungarian film, and the story is also pretty dull. I liked the first half, but then I started to get bored, and then I found the whole film just BORING.

What a vacuous shambles  None of these people come close to a Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc, and anyway, today s audience isn t as receptive to this facile muck. Writing is trivial. The hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious. The chemistry between the leading characters is non existent. It s interesting that Julia Roberts seems to think she s a reincarnation of some big star from the  golden age of Hollywood , whenever that may be.

ATP is used to store and transport chemical energy within cells because of the intermediate energy content of the diphosphate bonds.

Take young, pretty people, put them in an exotic locale, stick in a few bad guys, have the two lead characters find romance after a couple of heavy breathing scenes, create the flimsiest of plots, then work out a happy ending for everybody  other than the three or four who get murdered, of course  That s the classic  and successful  format of the Harlequin Romance.

I will admit that I did like some of the character development   the depictions of the humans as an  adolescent  species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining. And that Vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rack. But I don t think I m going to get hooked on this series. 3 10	0

Even Hollywood  professionals  apparently go to work just for a paycheck, although no one should have been paid for this bad work. Careers should instead have ENDED over this inconsequential drivel.

In 1692 Salem, a devious child s lies about a slave s involvement in witchcraft sends an entire community into an uproar. Costume drama starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray isn t stuffy, though neither is it a vivid depiction of contagious hysteria. Worked on by three writers  Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead, and Bradley King , the story elements are rather interesting  especially coming out of Hollywood in 1937 , though to anyone who has since read Arthur Miller s  The Crucible , the hoked up melodrama on display here won t be tolerated for very long. Biggest problem with the picture may lie in the casting  Colbert and MacMurray are an ill matched pair of lovers hindered by the witch hunt, MacMurray being far too contemporary a presence for these surroundings.  1 2 from     	0

If 1977 s  Exorcist II  The Heretic  did him no favors, it s hard to imagine what thespian extraordinaire Richard Burton saw in this drab exercise in non thrills. You ve seen it all before  Burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age he possesses the power to move inanimate objects through force of his mind  and you thought  Carrie  had no impact on Hollywood  . Though adapted from a novel by Peter Van Greenaway,  Medusa  plays like recycled goods, though the special effects in the cathedral finale are solid  if typical . Lee Remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but otherwise the supporting cast is extremely weak. Burton is hammy but weary...not even telekinesis could save him at this point.  1 2 from     	0

Director Fred Schepisi Roxanne  directs this well intentioned, but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein Matthau  trying to hook his scientific niece Ryan  up with ordinary guy Tim Robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950 s. To get Ryan to like Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is cute, but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat, but are unable to rescue the film. Its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie. I would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of Meg Ryan.	0

The intentions were good, I suppose, but things get awfully tiresome when the dialogue is SO nauseating.

I enjoyed the first reviewer s comment far more than I did the film when I saw it at a second run theatre in the early  80 s. I was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the Tenniel drawings. But to me, the cast was largely squandered, their personalities muffled by the masks, while the direction I think of as being unusually static, and the photography murky. The rating jotted down at the time was a nought, which means  not worth sitting through even once . Still, I too would jump at a chance to have a second look.	0

We saw this on the shelf at the local video store, saw  Coppola  in the credits and got excited. That was the one and only time this movie raised any interest. I could never quite work out if it was an attempt at a humourous film that failed miserably, or an attempt at a serious film that failed miserably. In general, the entire production seemed incredibly amatuerish. The sound in particular was absolutely dreadful, especially in the scenes shot in the little bar  the dialogue was so corny in parts it was unbelievable. Very disappointing.	0

there was some truth to this movie. I remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fisherman finding a body in the water and they chose not to report it until their trip was finished. I also recall they were charged with interfering with a corpse  or some such charge . I m not sure if it was in Australia. The viewers outside of Australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders. Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this perception. The film itself reminded me of A Simple Plan. But as far a being one of the best Australian films ever, as someone claimed, I can t be that generous. Put it this way, I wouldn t bother watching it again.	0

I don t have much to say about this movie. It could have been a wonderful tour de force for Peter Sellers, but it is one of the most tragic misfires in movie history. That it was Sellers final movie makes it all the more painful.

I wish so much that I could find even a snicker or a chuckle buried somewhere in this pile of putrid blubber, but it s a lifeless, humorless disaster. The truth hurts.

Basically, Cruel Intentions 2 is Cruel Intentions 1, again, only poorly done. The story is exactly the same as the first one  even some of the lines , with only a few exceptions. The cast is more unknown, and definitely less talented. Instead of being seductive and drawing me into watching it, I ended up feeling dirty because it compares to watching a soft core porn. I m not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic lines on the actors or the writers...and I always feel bad saying that, because I know how hard it is to do both...but it was basically a two hour waste of my life. It literally amazes me that some movies get made, and this is no exception...I can t believe they d make a third one.	0

From the pen of Richard Condon  The Manchurian Candidate 1962  comes this muddled tale of political intrigue and assassination. The story, told in almost comic book fashion is difficult to swallow. All star cast considered, this poor effort is not entirely the fault of the cast and crew  the novel was replete with the same short comings. It seems as though at times the story is actually mocking the more sincere effort put forth in  Manchurian Candidate.  A disappointment on all counts.	0

This was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store. Don t make the same mistake I did. This movie is tedious, unconvincingly acted, and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered  I cringed at every scene they shared. Dennis Hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self  his role was clearly not a stretch for him. And although the movie is supposedly set in Puerto Rico, it feels a lot more like a Hollywood movie lot  all of the main characters are Caucasian and several tend to speak English with pseudo Irish accents.

I won t describe the story, as that has been done elsewhere. We are great Clive Owen fans, and when our Netflix recommended the movie, we were intrigued. No wonder we had never heard of this  movie , because it was a BBC Television movie back in 1992. Hence, the poor production values, grainy image, jerky camera work and poor sound. But, you don t really mind the mechanics, because the story itself will put you to sleep. It s an interesting human story, but not at all compelling, and there is hardly any ending. You don t really care for the characters as their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie. Save the two hours and do something to make the time more worthwhile.	0

Harold Wright Cruse  March 8, 1916 March 30, 2005  was an outspoken social critic and teacher of African American studies at the University of Michigan until the mid 1980s. His most recognized work is The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual, which was published in the mid 1960s.

Such areas are designated as conservation areas if they are uninhabited and completely owned by the Government of India but used for subsistence by communities, and community areas if part of the lands are privately owned. Administration of such reserves would be through local people and local agencies like the gram panchayat, as in the case of communal forests.  See Communal forests of India 	2

Except for the all to clear Bill Gates allegory.

The mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the 80 s well with some good performances. However..... The script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where I expect it was intended to be edgy. The characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clich  s that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is this movie has no real story. It ticks all the right  arty  boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was. Very disappointing	0

Obvious early influences were Bartk and Stravinsky however the band also cited less well known composers such as Albert Huybrechts, who was also Belgian.	2

This film  along with Rinne  are minor gems amongst the retread homage pics that have passed for horror movies so far at the 8FTDF  HorrorFest.  And, yes, that s faint praise indeed.  Cause there s not much worse in filmdom than would be auteurs who think atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot. And that s all you get with The Abandoned. This is a film that was made almost entirely in the directors head. Sure, it would have been nice if he d transfered it to film, but this happened instead. It s a very pretty film with a few genuine scares, but the last reel is strictly for the latte slurping cineaste crowd.	0

The only reason I watched it until the end is because I teach video production and I wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad...but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though. It s like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy...excruciatingly painful. If you took the actual film, dipped it in paint thinner, then watched it, it would be more entertaining. Seriously. If you see this movie in the bargin bin at S Mart, back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake.	0

European Vacation  aka National Lampoon s European Vacation  is the weakest of the Vacation films  the first and third one the most superior of the films . While Chevy Chase and Beverly D Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold  with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold , this time they are given a weaker script with very bad dialogue. This causes the pacing to suffer, with the jokes not very funny at all. To be more specific, what really causes this film to suffer is the fact that the  jokes  as they are, are just pasted together into a cobbled together script , rather than serving a central plot as the other 3 Vacation films have. Oh well, they can t win them all. 4 out of 10.	0

All internet buzz aside, this movie was god awful. I expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything. Instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller horror movie, and they completely missed. There were only a few good parts, and a couple good lines by Samuel Jackson. Other than that, it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes. All of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie. Now that the movie has actually come out, hopefully this joke will die. Don t waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash.

Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A love biangle,  sorry for the poetical license, but is not a triangle   an interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes OK, the picture looks crowded and narrow sighted. The sound needs more attention  it usually does in Romanian movies , the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and is not helping the action. About the acting... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. The others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer. The acting is poetical when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetical. It s a picture for adults, told by the children. Bother only if extremely curious.	0

This is a movie about animal cruelty. Under the guise of a marathon race, we see depictions of extreme animal abuse, including literally running a horse to death IN SLOW MOTION. The guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the burial burning of the horse, which of course is still dead, having been tortured to death. This is one of the sickest, slimiest movies I ve ever had the displeasure of viewing. As Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line on their DYING animals, we re supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race. I d like to put the producers and director in a marathon race  I ll decide when they re finished, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.	0

There were so many goofs, mess ups, and bad editing that an old episode of Sesame Street would have been better to watch. The acting was OK, but please, you can really feel the  Straight to Video  feeling. The cast crew made this movie a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but just wait until ten minutes before the ending to hear it. Trust me, you wouldn t even tell the difference.	0

This solid little horror film is actually one of Renny Harlin s best. The story is pretty routine stuff, but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive  in fact, the ghost story is almost an afterthought. The real horror comes from the prison setting itself, and Renny H. spares no detail in showing us how bad the conditions are inside that crumbling, leaking, rat infested old hellhole  with a sadistic warden, too   Viggo Mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role, supported by some very authentic looking prisoners  there are no pretty boys in this cast.  Horror fans should check this one out.	0

Mean spirited, and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children s tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what Jim Carrey did but he should give up acting all together. He is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. I have seen a lot of bad film this year, but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made.	0
The plot of The Thinner is decidedly thin. And gross. An obese lawyer drives over the Gypsy woman, and the Gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight... to the bone.

And Michael McDowell, other horror author and the screenwriter of this abysmal film, does so, too. The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible, he is fat too, haha  The Thinner is like an immature piece of crap for a person who moans how he she has never seen anything so disgusting than fatness.

One of the worst movies I ever saw. My only thought was   how can I get my money back from Hollywood Video . This is no way worth four dollars, or any dollars. I think it was an attempt to rip off The Mexican, or Vin Diesel s movies, but it failed miserably to do this. The acting was terrible, I felt sorry for the actors that they couldn t find something better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We were calling out the lines ahead of the actors, it was so predictable. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated, worse than a cartoon. Skip it.	0

The worst movie I have seen in quite a while. Interesting first half with some engaging, terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late night bar. The movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock  read disgust  without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else. I wanted to walk out, but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect. Still, time is precious  as the director himself observed in his intro  and I really begrudge the time I wasted on the second half of this one. Saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie, especially the female lead.	0

I agree with the last reviewer that this movie had terrible acting. Yes, there was a lot of gore and some nudity. But it was overshadowed by a slow moving, meaningless plot and dumb ending. Where was this supposed to be filmed anyway  a Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong  Hostel was a much better movie and I would recommend seeing that instead. A technical annoyance I had with the DVD is that if you shut off the Spanish subtitles, they return after a few scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again. Also, don t waste your time on the deleted scenes because there s no audio and it just looks like tourist footage.	0

Pointless boring film with charismatic Mercurio completely wasted. Released for a minute on a Thursday in maybe one local cinema and avoided by the entire population of Sydney except me and four others BACK OF BEYOND is a project seemingly created by a producer looking for a fee. Local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better  well Polson has morphed into a Director of lame thrillers like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK  and Terry Serio seems never to get a guernsey apart from thug roles. But Paul Mercurio should have become one of Australia s greatest exports on screen. Roles like this are major disappointments and films like this are just a waste of talent and time.	0

For a film about a killer this is surprisingly dull. Nothing much happens and even when things do happen they don t generate any real excitement or interest. The acting is good from the two leads, Cassetti in particular delivers a great performance combining the certainty and stupidity of Succo but the rest of the cast also do what they need to. The problem is that there is poor writing and direction and the fact that as a true story it isn t interesting, Succo is not a unique character, he isn t interesting or exciting. Films of this sort normally try to generate tension or empathy or outrage and this generates nothing except a feeling of regret that you wasted your time watching it.	0

Mary Pickford becomes the chieftain of a Scottish clan after the death of her father, and then has a romance. As fellow commenter Snow Leopard said, the film is rather episodic to begin. Some of it is amusing, such as Pickford whipping her clansmen to church, while some of it is just there. All in all, the story is weak, especially the recycled, contrived romance plot line and its climax. The transfer is so dark it s difficult to appreciate the scenery, but even accounting for that, this doesn t appear to be director Maurice Tourneur s best work. Pickford and Tourneur collaborated once more in the somewhat more accessible  The Poor Little Rich Girl,  typecasting Pickford as a child character.	0

This typically melodramatic Bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of Western critics. The script is ludicrous, the acting is over the top, and it looks cheesy. The only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by Mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary Meena Kumari. Watching the actress, who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released, has the same fascination as watching a train wreck. Her ex husband, Amrohi, wrote and directed, but lacks the competency to execute either task well. Bollywood has produced far better films.	0
