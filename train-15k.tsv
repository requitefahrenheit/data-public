An infrared sauna is a sauna that heats its occupants with heaters that emit far infrared radiation. Unlike conventional saunas, which use heated steam, an infrared sauna does not heat the air. An infrared sauna is usually a wooden box containing several infrared heaters, although an infrared sauna could be open air and still heat the users in the same manner. In essence, the sauna box creates the atmosphere of the sauna while the heaters create the actual heating effect.	2

What this movie fails from answering is how wrong this war is  and most US wars recently made only to get some oil .

I had no expectations other than to be entertained for 90 minutes, and that is exactly what I was. Of course it is campy, of course some of the dialog wasn t perfect, of course the  special effects  were a bit hokey. That is exactly why I enjoyed the movie so much. It is a perfect fit for this genre of a 70 s Horror classic. The talent needs to start some where, that goes for the actors and the crew, and what better piece of material to sharpen your skills on than this.

Terrible film made on a budget of about  9.99. Very obvious miniature sets used, poor acting and an awful storyline concerning aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship. The film contains some blood  not enough to disturb  and a character with an eggbeater replacing one of his hands.  Yes you read that correctly.  One saving grace was a song performed at the  talent show   how s that for irony   by a punk new wave band that I think was called  I m A Heat Seeking Missile . Other than that, this is not worth your time, not even on a  so bad it s good  level. Watch if you are into cheesy alien films, but anyone else should steer clear. Rating  1 out of 10	0

Alfred Hitchcok is not my favorite director by any means but imagine what he could have done with this  The plot holds much potential for suspense. John Garfield is as almost always excellent and Raymond Massey is scarily cast against type. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive leading lady but the supporting cast is large and very capable. Yes it starts to sag fairly early. There are too many coincidences. And an important subject is trivialized by its being made into little more, in the end, than a love story. It s fun to watch for Garfield, Massey, and the character performers. But it s not awfully good.	0

One or more users were supported in separate address spaces sharing the same language interpreter. The syntax of the language was similar to but not identical to BASIC 11. A key language element was the support for virtual files. These were similar to the virtual arrays in BASIC PLUS in but more limited. An array of integers, floatingpoint, or character strings of length 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 could be placed in file and accessed with a subscript.

This film is roughly what it sounds like  a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend but with songs and  fairly tame  sex scenes  The film is not sure what it wants to be and pretty much ends up a mess. It s more expensive looking than most of director Al Adamson s films but it s not at the same budget level that viewers have come to expect from sci fi films. The actors are pretty bad and unlike most Adamson films, there are no former big namers or B actors. Some of the music is OK but it s easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years.	0

The movie appeals to public due to charisma of Ben Stiller and notoriety of J. Aniston. It seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title, but there s nothing successful in this movie. Polly is very well played by Aniston, no doubt. This is the kind of character which suits her perfectly. Bem Stiller is the same troublesome guy like in   Meet the parents , but in this movie the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned above. The script is very poor with nothing special at all.

Subjectivism is a philosophical tenet that accords primacy to subjective experiences as fundament of all measure and law. In an extreme form, it may hold that the nature and existence of every object depends only on someone s subjective awareness of it. For example, Wittgenstein wrote in Tractatus Logico Philosophicus   The subject doesn t belong to the world, but it is a limit of the world   proposition 5.632 . One may also consider the qualified empiricism of George Berkeley in this context, given his reliance on God as the prime mover of human perception.	2
An adverse drug reaction  abbreviated ADR  is a term to describe the unwanted, negative consequences sometimes associated with the use of different medications.

Decent animation and some workable character development keep this animated horse fable from DreamWorks at least watchable... however it remains somewhat slow paced and the storyline is a bit on the silly side..

Probably the worst Bollywood film I ve seen. No plot line. Very little character developments. Full of silly and pointless humor. The whole film was chaotic and direction less. There was no proper ending to the story. The airport was filmed in a shopping mall. Same story chewed over and over again until you want to say  please, just move on with it    Even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographed. The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around... but then most of the Bollywood movies have that anyways these days. Btw I m not from an Indian background 2 10	0

Frank Tashlin s  The Home Front  is one of the more lifeless Private Snafu shorts, a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military. Rather than have Snafu take some inadvisable actions leading to disaster,  The Home Front  instead focuses on his loved ones back home and how much they have to offer to the war effort too. Snafu realises he was wrong when he thought they had it easy. It s a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead Tashlin plays the risqu   card more heavily, extended jokes involving strippers and scantily clad dancing girls in place of much effective comic relief. The result is a well meaning short which has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as an historical artefact.	0

The Eagles shared Ruppert Stadium with the minor league Newark Bears.	2
For loyal Duran Duran fans who want to watch a good music video, skip this one. The producers decided to get creative and make this 80 s video something of a sci fi story, involving the evil Barbarella villain from which the band got its name. What makes this idea fail is that right in the middle of some great 80 s Duran Duran songs, confusing and annoying cut scenes take place showing the fictional antagonist trying to stop the band at one of their concerts. Not only is the good music repeatedly interrupted, but we have to suffer through some cheap spin off story hosted by an evil Dr. Mario. It s almost too much to bear. 2 10	0

It is like what the title of this thread say. Only impression I got from that movie is that Marlee Matlin s character was always angry, so cynical, and so pathetic. Her character s first date with William Hurt s character where they were dancing were dumb. All in all, I ve tried to finish watching the movie four times, and of all four times I fell asleep. I would keep watching that movie with one intention... to beat my problem with insomnia, because all it do is to put me to sleep. Sweet dream.	0

I have only seen Gretchen Mol in two other films  Girl 6, Donnie Brasco , and don t really remember her, but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy. She really didn t think what she was doing was wrong, even when she left the business and found her religion again. The photos she made were certainly tame by today s standards, and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited, and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography.

Completely ridiculous  period  film is only a thin excuse for its extensive, graphic depiction of the heroine s affair with  the beast , a monster who supposedly appears every century to rape some women. That s pretty much what he does, and the film s depiction of the beast is really really awful  it s basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge PVC tube for a hard on that squirts copious amounts of white liquid. For fans of fake animal porn, I guess maybe this is a real turn on. I was amused, however, by the opening shots of horses having sex in a public square.	0

Syntactic Web is a phrase meant to describe the current, mostly HTML based World Wide Web, in order to distinguish it from the Semantic Web, a concept in which web pages carry information that can be read and understood by machines in a systematic way. The term stems from the contrast between syntax, which is the mechanics of a language used to convey information, and semantics, which is the actual meaning of that information. On a syntactic web page, which is any document on the web that does not contain special tagging to convey meaning, meaning is difficult to parse by a computer program.	2

I rarely comment on films but I ve read the other comments and I cannot believe that there are people applauding this celluloid rubbish. I know there are certain people who have their own agenda but lets take it on merit  poorly acted, badly shot and the story felt as the director was making it up as he was going along. I am not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving little kids as the makers of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience would want. All I can say is it is a terrible film, the content is poor and offensive, the production is amateurish and I am glad they could not make a film like this legally today	0

Fot the most part, this movie feels like a  made for TV  effort. The direction is ham fisted, the acting  with the exception of Fred Gwynne  is overwrought and soapy. Denise Crosby, particularly, delivers her lines like she s cold reading them off a cue card. Only one thing makes this film worth watching, and that is once Gage comes back from the  Semetary.  There is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone, and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason. It is absolutely bone chilling. This film only does one thing right, but it knocks that one thing right out of the park. Worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so.	0

But nonetheless, it was an easy going comedy. I think many people try to read far too much into a comedy. All they are supposed to do is make you laugh  that s all.

The plot was quite interesting, with the Russian revolution background. I also enjoyed seeing Budapest as the movie was partly filmed there. Sadly, there was zero chemistry between the 2 main characters so it was hard to believe the love story between them. The love scenes were forced and mechanical. Jordan kirckland was really stiff, almost icy. Rob Stewart was quite charming and boyish, so she looked like his older sister rather than his girlfriend. The ending, when we finally figure out who was actually after them, was quite weak and made no sense whatsoever. I think I would have enjoyed this movie a lot better if the relationship between the 2 actors was slightly more credible.	0

Obvious early influences were Bartk and Stravinsky however the band also cited less well known composers such as Albert Huybrechts, who was also Belgian.	2

Patients are also thought to experience altered sex drive, lessened inhibitions and other personality changes.

Absolutely nothing happens in this sloooow, annoying, thrill less thriller directed by Amenabar s usual collaborator Mateo Gil. The film, which in some way deals with the effect of boredom and the quest for thrills, actually delivers none, and seems like an exercise in boredom. The only mildly suspenseful moment is the movie s climax, which takes about 30 seconds of the whole agonizing 100 plus minutes, and is resolved too simply. The plot lacks sophistication or credibility, and while the idea is original, the way the story unfolds is arbitrary and every plot device or twist is a result of outside interference  deus ex machina . The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or resourcefulness. If you re fans of the genre, watch  Tesis  instead.	0

When anti bush jokes get really easy to do, a show like this had better make sure it has something extra. When that something extra is kid versions of political figures making jokes about the future they don t have yet, it s just plain nonsense. Dick Cheney and George Bush are done well but Dick Cheney mutters mostly. There s also Condoleeza Rice who has a crush on Bush for some reason and Donald Rumsfeld who isn t really that similar to Donald Rumsfeld at all. The democratic characters rarely give their names so it s a mystery as to who could be who aside from Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton. The episodes have coherent stories but that s not nearly enough to keep this from sinking.	0

Didn t Bug s Life also do that  I think it was at Disneyworld in that tree, so I m saying before they go and use that as there logo. Also, Shrek 3d was a motion simulator at Universal Studios. They should still consider it as a movie, because it appeared in a  theater  and you could buy it for DVD. The movie was cute, at least the little flyes were. I liked IQ. I agree with animaster, they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out and back adventure. I recommend it to families and kids.	0

I find it hard to understand why this piece of utter trash was repackaged. The only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of Ariauna in her sexy uniform. Her humour is also to be appreciated.

Can t say the same for her co star Lilith with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system. Appeared disinterested   gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed. All said apart from Ariauna s performance it is indeed utter trash.	0

This film had such promise   What a great idea, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, only to lose it s speed due to bad dialoge, poor editing and a half written story. The characters in the beginning were interesting, only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people sputtering out tired one liners. Maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge it would have been a great movie, instead of a almost afterthought effort.	0

This HAS to be the worst movie I ve ever attempted to watch. In the first 15 minutes, there wasn t anything to keep my interest in this movie. I was on vacation at the time, and had plenty of time to devote to a just for the fun of it movie. The condo we were staying in had this movie in stock  they must have got it from the  1 store or something. If you like Adam Sandler, this is nothing like any other movie he s made. This started with a bad premise and then just got worse. There s nothing even remotely funny in it. I ve watched a lot of movies, including some I didn t care for. But if you decide to waste your time on this movie, don t say I didn t warn you.	0

Claudius Mamertinus  flourished mid late 4th century  was an official in the Roman Empire. In 362, he was made consul by Emperor Julian  on January 1 of that year he delivered a panegyric in Constantinople by way of thanks to the Emperor. The text of this is still extant, preserved in the Panegyrici Latini and is followed by two panegyrics to the Emperor Maximian  the first delivered in 289 and the second in 290 or 291 . The text that has survived also attributes these to Claudius Mamertinus, either indicating that there was another, older orator by this name or that the sole manuscript source is corrupt.	2
Possible Spoilers    When I saw this today I had some expectation of how it would be like, not too high, but not low either. This was nothing like I expected at all though, it seems to me like the movie makers couldn t make up their mind of what kind of movie to make. In the begining of the film it s somewhat mysterious and kinda exciting, but that ll soon change to some ridiculous scenes   very obvious scenes... As I watched further I almost fell asleep a couple of times. The ending is the most ridiculous of all though, almost splatter comedy... I m not saying it doesn t have some good scenes it s just that the film never becomes  whole . 4 10 Movie Man	0

...this verson doesn t mangle the Bard that badly. It s still a horrible minimalist production, Hamlet s Dutch uncle is inexplicably dubbed by a Spaniard  whether it s Ricardo Montalban or not is subject to debate , and Maximilian Schell overacts like never before.

Mostly it s just bad acting, though.	0

Quite possibly the worst movie I ve ever seen  I was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes. The only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners. Don t get me wrong, I love silly, stupid movies just as much as the next gal, but the whole premise, writing and humor stunk. It seemed to me that they were going for a  Napoleon Dynamite  feel   strange and random scenes which would lead to a cult audience. Instead, it ended up being forced, awkward and weird. The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I just felt utterly awful that she  and Sissy Spacek  had signed up for this horrible thing. Thank gosh I didn t pay for it.	0

Since we are in fact carbon based life forms, excluding other elements as the central atoms of life could be considered chauvinistic.	2

Dieter  is the first name of a quite popular German musician, who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and thats exactly what this movie is about. It is based on the autobiography  Dieter Bohlen  wrote a few years ago but isn t meant to be accurate on that. The movie is filled with some sexual offensive content  at least for American standard  which is either amusing  not for the other  actors  of course  or dumb   it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a  Bohlen  Fan or not. Technically speaking there isn t much to criticize. Speaking of me I find this movie to be an OK movie.	0

Guy Ritchie s noble effort is beat up, knocked down, raped, kicked around, shot, stabbed, spit upon, punched, sodomized, and abused and left for dead by Madonna s dreadful performance. Her acting was very reminiscent of a graduate from the Al Gore School of Dramatics and Public Speaking. Guy Ritchie did do a somewhat noble attempt to remake this, and if you exclude ALL of the scenes that his wife was in, it s a fair movie at best. I think that the best acting job ever, had to be Guy comforting his wife that her performance was good enough not to re shoot.

I m not a huge Freddy Krueger fan,but that doesn t mean that I don t like Robert Englund and his other Nightmare on Elm Street movies.I think that Robert is a very good actor.Nobody plays a better Freddy Krueger than he does.But,no offense Robert, this movie sucked.The acting is terrible,the plot is really weak,and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that s even worth watching.Sometimes sequels can be better than the first,such as the Friday the 13th franchise I thought the remake was the best in the series. But this isn t one of those movies.The original was good,the 2nd in my opinion was better,the 3rd was okay but I haven,t seen the others.Whatever you do,don,t make the same mistake I did by watching this piece of crap.	0

I saw this movie way back at the first theatrical release, in a justifiably empty theater. Believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, this one still sticks clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time  or at least the worst that I would allow myself to watch. The acting is far beneath the standard set by any random group of drunken high school students yanked off the street and forced to learn their lines in 5 minutes or less. After the first shock of disbelief, we laughed for a while as each scene hit new lows. But after a while, even that dubious pleasure wore off and it just got to be really sad.	0

This is a movie about animal cruelty. Under the guise of a marathon race, we see depictions of extreme animal abuse, including literally running a horse to death IN SLOW MOTION. The guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the burial burning of the horse, which of course is still dead, having been tortured to death. This is one of the sickest, slimiest movies I ve ever had the displeasure of viewing. As Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line on their DYING animals, we re supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race. I d like to put the producers and director in a marathon race  I ll decide when they re finished, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.	0

For a film about a killer this is surprisingly dull. Nothing much happens and even when things do happen they don t generate any real excitement or interest. The acting is good from the two leads, Cassetti in particular delivers a great performance combining the certainty and stupidity of Succo but the rest of the cast also do what they need to. The problem is that there is poor writing and direction and the fact that as a true story it isn t interesting, Succo is not a unique character, he isn t interesting or exciting. Films of this sort normally try to generate tension or empathy or outrage and this generates nothing except a feeling of regret that you wasted your time watching it.	0

In general, information processing is the changing  processing  of information in any manner detectable by an observer. As such, it is a process which describes everything which happens  changes  in the universe, from the falling of a rock  a change in position  to the printing of a text file from a digital computer system. In the latter case, an information processor is changing the form of presentation of that text file.	2
This movie is another fine example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, since about 1997, seems to be best at  hyping up a movie a year before its release and not coming through with a quality movie. I m no film critic, but this movie was as predictable as they come. Every attempt at a joke, every attempt at a touching moment, and the pitiful attempt at a love story, was exactly what I was predicting in my mind. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this one.	0
This movie displayed more racial hatred of Jews by David Mamet than I have have ever encountered in an American film. The sterotypes are so over the top that my ability to continue watching died.

I am deeply disturbed at the concept that Jews are not Americans and  different . I suggest that Mr. Mamet is one of the causes of hatred not a healer of same.	0

Proof that not everything Tarantino touches turns to gold. This is most definitely plastic, all the way. Its easy to see that without Quentin s involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years, that s assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place. It is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes, Angela Jones is unconvincing in this role, William Baldwin is better as the Serial Killer who keeps Jones in employment .

The remake of H.B. Halicki s classic seventies chase film is simply horrible. Along with Vanishing Point, Gone in 60 Seconds represent the quintessential car chase films. The remake takes the original and stands it on its head. Whereas Halicki gave us 75  car chase and 25  supporting drama, in GISS 2000 we get 25  car chase and 75  supporting drama. Cage as super man, saves his brother, kisses the girl. MTV edits, tits and ass. Save your money, rent the original.

The kind of look that might be useful to a homosexual aversion therapist. Others have given this thing the dishing it deserves.

The Generation of Columbuses    is a term denoting the entire generation of Poles born soon after Poland regained her independence in 1918, and whose adolescence has been marked by the tragic times of the World War II. The term itself was coined by Roman Bratny in his well received 1957 novel Kolumbowie. Rocznik 20 and was itself based on the name of Christopher Columbus, as Bratny described the entire generation as the ones who discovered Poland. The term is generally applied to young intelligentsia, but it also includes all young people who, instead of living their lives the way most 20 year old people do, had to fight against the foreign occupation and study at secret universities.	2

Iedereen Beroemd  has everything we can expect from a straight to video movie. It s the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star. The only thing he needs is to get her on stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail. The problem with the movie is not the basic plot, but how it is made. Everything is supposed to be funny, but it isn t. It is trivial and clumsy, the characters are shallow, and the end sequence is totally without climax or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing, but only at how pathetic the whole set up is.	0

Actually, do not see this movie, period. Please. At least not seriously. Its jokes are not funny  to say the least , and you ll have much more fun parodying or watching a parody of it then viewing the movie.

The whole notion that Streisand plays a boy man only begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous a premise this movie is. The single most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of  willing suspension of disbelief  . . . it is impossible to do that in this movie.	0

No redeeming features, this film is rubbish. Its jokes don t begin to be funny. The humour for children is pathetic, and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package. Sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next. I couldn t enjoy the film at all. Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike with Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc. which all get frequent requests for replays.	0

The Mahamuni Buddha, also known as the Maha Myat Muni Buddha, is a major Buddhist pilgrimage site in Mandalay, Myanmar  formerly Burma . The Buddha statue was brought from Rakhine State in 1784 by King Bodawpaya as spoils of war. It is 4 metres high, and the statue is made of bronze, weighing 6.5 tons. Gold leaf is regularly applied to the face of the Mahamuni Buddha, and monks wash the face and teeth of the image each morning. The Buddha is housed under a pagoda built in the 1800s. Adjacent to the Buddha is the Mahamuni Museum, which contains displays of Buddhism throughout Asia.	2

Body load is a term employed by users of psychoactive drugs, and especially users of psychedelics, to describe specific tactile sensations brought on by drug use. Generally, body load is an unpleasant physical sensation that is difficult to describe either in terms of other sensations or in its specific location.  It is usually an  all over  or  everywhere  sensation, except when accompanied by nausea, as noted below.  Body load is, for most purposes, synonymous with the term  body buzz   and sometimes  buzzing  in general, when the latter term was used to describe feelings accompanying the onset of effects of such drugs as LSD 25 and psilocin  this usage was more common during the 1960s, however, and a  buzz  now usually means a feeling of light intoxication. 	2

This movie is some of the worst crap I have ever seen. I literally got a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie. The CGI was awful, and the story was just a waste of ink. Dean Cain s character was Mr Super Intuitive I can figure out anything, except he can t seem to work his own helicopter correctly. The biggest problem was the split screen camera work. I felt like I was watching the Brady Bunch or something, only it wasn t different people in the boxes, just close ups and different views of the same thing. I can only figure that the actors really needed the money, because this movie wasn t worth the film it was shot on.	0

In 2004, I liked it. Then it became very stupid. It suggests that kids are brainless. It insults children. Cartoon Network used to be great. One of the shows I liked was Hamtaro. It did manage to be interesting and imaginative in its approach to children programming. The show  Foster s Home for Imaginary Friends  is like putting 20 spoons of sugar in your Sprite. It seems as if today s television producers are only interested in making money, rather than engaging the imaginations of children and making money  Lately, my children are tuning in to the old shows  60 s  to find something interesting to watch. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, for television to look to its past and recycle children s programing from days gone by.	0

After reading the other reviews for this film I am of the opinion that the high markers are probably paid studio lackeys as the film I saw was absolutely dire, with wooden acting, lacklustre scripting and plodding predictable directing, one of the few plus points has to be the stunning scenery as this film features some stunning backdrops with great sweeping vistas and dramatic skies and wide open prairies, sadly when the most memorable thing in a film is the part featured behind the actors this has to be a warning sign as to the quality of the movie, all in all a thoroughly uninspiring addition to the western genre which even at the very reasonable price it can be obtained on DVD is best to avoid.	0

Millions of indigenous people lived in the Americas when the 1492 voyage of Christopher Columbus began an historical period of large scale European contact with the Americas. European contact with what they called the  New World  led to the European colonization of the Americas, with millions of emigrants  willing and unwilling  from the  Old World  eventually resettling in the Americas. While the population of Old World peoples in the Americas steadily grew in the centuries after Columbus, the population of the American indigenous peoples plummeted. The extent and causes of this population decline have long been the subject of controversy and debate. The 500th anniversary of Columbus s famous voyage, in 1992, drew renewed attention to claims that indigenous peoples of the Americas had been the victims of genocide.	2

I ve seen the original non dubbed German version and I was surprised how bad this movie actually is. Thinking I had seen my share of bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and such, nothing could ve prepared me for this  It really was a pain to sit through this flick, as there s no plot, no good acting and even the special effects aren t convincing, especially the so called zombies, wearing nothing more than white make up and their old clothes, so their good set wouldn t be ruined by ketchup and marmalade stains.

This movie is NOT the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and that is a shame because the 1954 version is, in my opinion, much better. I am not denying Barbra Streisand s talent at all. She is a good actress and brilliant singer. I am not acquainted with Kris Kristofferson s other work and therefore I can t pass judgment on it. However, this movie leaves much to be desired. It is paced slowly, it has gratuitous nudity and foul language, and can be very difficult to sit through. However, I am not a big fan of rock music, so it s only natural that I would like the Judy Garland version better. See the 1976 film with Barbra and Kris, and judge for yourself.	0

In mathematics, a primitive notion is a concept not defined in terms of previously defined concepts, but only motivated informally, usually by an appeal to intuition and everyday experience. For example in naive set theory, the notion of an empty set is primitive.  That it exists is an implicit axiom.  For a more formal discussion of the foundations of mathematics see the axiomatic set theory article. In an axiomatic theory or formal system, the role of a primitive notion is analogous to that of axiom. In axiomatic theories, the primitive notions are sometimes said to be  defined  by the axioms, but this can be misleading.	2

In economics, the distinction is often made between stock magnitudes and flow magnitudes. A  stock  is something one has accumulated in the past and has on hand at any one time. It would be measured using simple units  such as dollars or tons . On the other hand, a  flow  is something that occurs over time and would be measured as dollars per year or tons per month or similar. The diagram contrasts the flows of new investment  and of depreciation or depletion  with the stock of capital currently on hand.	2

Surprisingly, when I was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this film, I found the characters to be interesting and highly engaging. I just don t usually watch that much late night TV, so I can t recommend this film, unless watching paint dry is your idea of an exciting two hours out of your life.	0

Marcus Valerius Mesalla Corvinus, the main protagonist in David Wishart s series of detective novels set in Imperial Rome, is thinly based on a real historical character, but as the author admits, considerable liberties have been taken. Of senatorial rank  i.e. upper class , Marcus Corvinus spurns the conventional career path followed by his contemporaries and develops a taste for investigating politically sensitive matters, thereby enabling the author to  a  introduce many historical figures, warts and all  and b  continue Marcus Corvinus s adventures around the Roman Empire. The books are well written and the plots not at all straightforward.	2

Okay, first off, Seagal s voice is dubbed over for like 50  of the film... Why  Because apparently there were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions. From the very beginning, you just scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting, but they make no sense. That said, the story still sucked and doesn t make any sense at all. When I got the the end, I was just scratching my head cause the movie was so pointless and the ending didn t even make sense. Avoid like the plague. This movie made me stop watching Seagal straight to video movies cause they just get worse and worse.	0

I kept my fingers crossed that it would work out and it would all be some horrible misunderstanding, right up until when the credits rolled and I realised that there was not going to be a happy and contented ending. Unfortunately i was left regretting that i d watched it and hurriedly putting on some quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the Great Scott 	0

Paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit. Everybody is unpleasant, and for no reason.

I still can t believe how bad this movie was. If I wasn t a massochist I don t know if I would have survived the viewing. It looks like it cost about  1000 to make, but it wasn t the money that brought them down. The acting was horrid   not just bad, 3rd graders could have read the lines better. Second, the only other reason to watch this kind of movie is the skin, and that is sorely lacking in this flick. We don t even get to see the more attractive chicas in the buff.

I actually have a fondness for Christopher Lee, but this just wasn t up to his other performances... and he was one of the better actors. The film does not live up to its premise. It s not that scary, it s overly melodramatic, and it draaaaaags. Every time I thought,  Oh, HERE comes the good part  the good part never quite arrived. The Evil Ones aren t at all convincing. Most of the other characters were also lacking in depth. Perhaps if I d been in the proper frame of mind, I might have enjoyed some MSTie fication at this film s expense, but.... Naaahhh... Didn t really seem to be worth the effort. It wasn t really very good, it wasn t really very bad, it was just mediocre.	0

Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many missing characters, no romantic scenes, changes in story line, too short, appeared low budget. Hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you re not familiar with the novel. In some scenes it looks like Lorna has a cold sore on her upper lip. I m sure make up did it s best to hide it. I guess they didn t want to halt filming until it healed up, pity. Most likely why this movie lacked kissing scenes. Only one disappointing kissing scene at the very end. Lorna Doone is a great epic tale and should be told true. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, much more enjoyable and more true to the book.	0

Municipal bond arbitrage, also called municipal bond relative value arbitrage, municipal arbitrage, or just muni arb, generally consists of building a leveraged portfolio of high quality, tax exempt municipal bond and simultaneously hedging the duration risk in that municipal bond portfolio by shorting the equivalent taxable corporate bonds. These corporate equivalents are typically interest rate swaps referencing Libor or BMA  short for Bond Market Association  . Muni arb is a relative value strategy that seizes upon an inefficiency that is related to government tax policy  interest on municipal bonds is exempt from federal income tax. Because the source of this arbitrage is artificially imposed by government regulation, it has persisted  i.e., it has not been  arbed away   for decades.	2

Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I ve never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.	0

I was utterly disappointed by this movie. I had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations. I expected a drama with more intense character development. But that never happens in the movie. Daniel Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe. I tought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I would rate his performance 6 out of 10. Acting  6 out of 10 Direction is 5 out of 10. Script is the worst  2 out of 10. I deleted the movie from my DVR at 70 mins. into the movie. Much better movies out there than this...	0

Geez  This is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you didn t. I mean, you didn t give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mind. To be honest and brief  this is one of the worst, boring, and stupid slashers ever made. I can t say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell it s made by professional film makers. The death scenes are horrible, bloodless, stupid. The plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied  Popcorn  from 1991. To make things even worse, this isn t a movie so bad that it s good. It s just plain bad. Molly Ringwald tried to do her best but it wasn t enough.	0

Chris Kattan is a great sketch actor on Saturday Night Live...but he should probably leave the movie industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control. He plays an annoyingly peppy character who basically comes off as mildly retarded and on speed. Wanna know the only funny parts  The stuff they showed in the previews. Yes, his rendition of take on me is funny. Nothing else is. ESPECIALLY when you can tell he s trying very hard to be a physical comedian, which he shouldn t have to try at because he is one. And yet, his  demolishing the vet s office  bit comes off as cringingly bad. This movie made me develop an eye twitch. Avoid it at all costs, and keep watching SNL.	0

Being a fan of silent films, I looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time. I was pretty disappointed. As has been mentioned, the film seems to be one long, long, commercial for the Maxwell automobile. Perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length that it is, I may have enjoyed the film more. But it got old very fast. And while I recognize that reality is stretched many times in films, without lessening a viewer s enjoyment, what was with the Mexican bandits  I mean, they are chasing a car through the mountains, a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour, yet they can t catch up to it 	0

Trite, clich  d dialog and plotting  the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980s fantasy movies , hokey music, and a paint by numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fans. What saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of Bakshi s work, the rotoscoping, and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him. This is Frazetta...in motion. The violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword   sorcery movie of the period. I like to watch this with the sound off, playing the soundtrack to the first Conan movie instead.	0

Baba   Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie which caused his downfall. It was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred. Soon after its release, he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably. Its a very bad movie with horrible acting, bad quality makeup and pathetic screenplay. Throughout the movie, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease. I m one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba, first day first show in theatre. The audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission. Sorry, I ll not recommend this one to anyone.	0

He mumbles some more, she composes another eulogy, etc., etc. The dreadful events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is overwhelmingly sad, but this plodding insipid dramatization is distressingly boring.	0

They later supported the Hartford Convention s disaffection with the War of 1812 and proposed secession of New England. Some members of the Essex Junto were Timothy Pickering, George Cabot, and Theophilus Parsons.	2

From the beginning of the movie I had a feeling like its a movie about another Jason s from Friday the 13th. And It is... Dispute that the movie starts interesting. But as the times goes by its just a pointless movie about muted, supernatural, silent serial killer. I mean he goes under the guy s bed without making any sound, not seen by anyone. He was supposed to be blind after failed execution but he walks and kills people like he used to. I m tired of it. For me it s all over the same thing. In another words   unreal. Too many mistakes and confusing information. Well scene with tide up woman looked impressive but just at first time    For that and for intriguing intro 2 stars.	0

Perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencia s comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the people in the crowd that aren t laughing.

Then again, perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencia s comedy is that he doesn t get off his free speech high horse. If you want to be funny, just make a joke, don t explain all the reasons why you re saving the American way with your failed attempts at generating laughter. Hmm... actually... the worst thing about Carlos Mencia s comedy is that it substitues meanspirited jabs at ethnicities for legitimate humor. Avoid this like the plague.	0

One of the worst films ever. Not funny, poor TV style cinematography, bad acting. Sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk, let alone act. Lead female Nancy Young can t act. Terrible direction. Sub par with bad TV movies. Occasional weak jokes fall flat. Even the basic premise of the movie makes no sense. Somehow they are supposed to stop a wedding from happening but there s no logic behind their actions. Slow pacing made my wife stop watching but I suffered through it. The old men are supposed to be acting like they are young and horny, but it comes off as pathetic instead of funny. How did they even get the money to make this 	0

Born, raised, and educated in Scotland, I was appalled at this disgusting portrayal of a man who was no more nor less than a cattle rustler. Worse yet, the thread of the entire movie was sex in one form or another, by implication or verbally. To view it, one would think that 18th century Scotland was populated by a bunch of sex perverts and homosexuals. Lange was a joke acting as the  young  mother at age 49 but Liam Neeson was even worse  Taking a  bath  in a Scottish loch is NOT commonplace as they portrayed him   but, it did give them yet another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually driven we were.

This film is actually trying to make a point, by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad. 4 10 Fair comedy, gross out film.	0

Intelligent Martian lands on Earth and meets the not too bright humans, in his view. The usual wackiness ensues with the human, Bridges, eventually bonds with him and helps him to get home. Along the way he also gets the girl, Hannah. This is a nice outing for some pleasant Hollywood stars who I had not seen for a while. Pleasant enough to pass some spare time if you have not got anything better to view.	0

That, I suppose, in the context of a commercial Hollywood film is just about tolerable, but what s with all the praise for Russell Crowe s performance  The man just seems to shuffle about, clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting  Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that Crowe s performance is little short of caricature. It is also rather offensive. And, dare I say, just on the right side of being truly terrible	0

Quebec law is unique in Canada because Quebec is the only province in Canada to have a civil law system. The core areas of the matters of private law that are, incidentally, in the exclusive jurisdiction of the province, such as property, contracts and other forms of civil liability, are codified in its civil code, the Civil Code of Quebec. Lawyers in Quebec must have a civil law degree and complete a stage  apprenticeship  and a bar admission course before they can practise. Criminal law is, however, based on the common law system.

At a panel discussion that I attended after viewing this film, the filmmakers stated that one should look at this not as a movie but a provoker of thought. Well, the only thoughts that were provoked from me were of the time wasted watching the movie. The gimmicks of the film  documentary style, futuristic setting  served as distractions of what was supposed to be a thoughtful examination of the abortion debate. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use film as a platform for their political views   usually a very boring movie that preaches to the choir.	0
This movie is one of those I regret having invested 90 minutes of my life that I ll never get back in. The premise is really interesting   essentially it s a zombie flick from the perspective of the undead  let s not split hairs as to whether they re actually dead or not . Unfortunately, they fail to deliver a compelling story within this framework. The nearly unbearable monotony of the lives of the central characters may add to the realism of the film, but it sucks all the entertainment value right out of it. If they had put a little more effort toward keeping the viewer engaged, it would have been much more likely that they drive home the social commentary.	0

Sean Bean is great, as are the photography, locations and costumes. However, the plot is somewhat muddled, and the conclusion flat. The plot has been SUBSTANTIALLY altered from Cornwell s novel, and not to the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better read than watched. Sharpe was too narrowly drawn here, in contrast with his literary alter ego, who seems more intelligent and determined despite his apprehension in his new role as an officer promoted from the ranks. I really enjoyed the brief scene in which Sharpe is tripped by a  real  officer, and after a quick pause and piercing stare, pushes the surprised and cowed officer right back. It sets the tone for his later trials as a commanding officer. Rating   4  of  10. 	0

I thought the movie was OK but very disappointed that they didn t capture the true image of his life. I was so anticipating to see his mother being an actual Jamaican, that it s driving me crazy.

I m very disappointed, that s like watching a biography story on Mark Anthony and having Arnold play the part. I don t know what the writer was thinking missing a valuable piece of the movie which I m sure his mother played a huge role in his life. I will say the movie was OK besides the major Fla      	0

Except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads, this movie is really, really bad. The cheap production values don t help. Of course, you wouldn t really notice that the production values are cheap if they didn t keep trying to convince you they HAD a production values to begin with. Even for a B movie genre freak like myself, this movie really sucks.	0
There is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn t help with the major downsides to the movie. I never understand why directors ask actors actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can t convince. Fiennes just can t do Irish and Fitzgerald isn t much better at Russian. When the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing. As the for the major problem....the plot....was there one  I guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that I just couldn t wait for the film to end...it was ridiculous.

The Accot Zhai steering law, also known as Accot s law  Accot is pronounced ah caught in English and ah koh in French  or the steering law, is a model of human movement. It predicts the average time necessary to navigate, or steer, a pointing device  such as a mouse or stylus  through a 2D path or tunnel or trajectory, where the user must travel from one end of the path to the other as quickly as possible, while staying within the confines of the path. One potential practical application of this law is in modelling a user s performance in navigating a hierarchical cascading menu.	2

Not much to say on this one. A plot you can pretty much peg, in the first 10 minutes. Nothing overly wrong with this film, very little action for an action film. There was a chance to explore the characters emotions occasionally. Whether an action film is the right genre to do that with, I m still undecided. Sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without giving full attention to, as it had little twists and a straightforward plot. I was probably guilty of that, so with a second watch or with undivided attention it may be better. 4 10  but the best of my 4 out of 10 s 	0

There is enough darkness in the novel, but Bronte s Rochester is relatively young, athletic, powerful, and charming when he chooses to be. He has a fine speaking and singing voice, a good mind, and a conscience that he unsuccessfully attempts to stifle.	0

The Athens Conservatoire  Greek    is the oldest conservatoire in modern Greece. It was founded in 1871 by the Athens Music and Drama Society. Initially, the musical instruments that were taught there were limited to the violin and the flute, representative of the ancient Greek Apollonian and Dionysian aesthetic principles. Significantly, piano lessons were not included in the program. In 1881 its new German taught director Georgios Nazos, in a controversial at that time move, expanded the conservatoire s program by introducing Western European style instruments and theory material.	2

I only rented this because i loved the first movie. However, calling it John Carpenters Vampires  Los Muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it. He is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film  Jeepers Creepers Anyone   A tragic storyline, terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing Vampire Hunter of all time. It s not even comically bad. What we end up with is a dull, uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clich  d acting. It just reeks of low budget. Avoid like the Bubonic plague.	0
there was some truth to this movie. I remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fisherman finding a body in the water and they chose not to report it until their trip was finished. I also recall they were charged with interfering with a corpse  or some such charge . I m not sure if it was in Australia. The viewers outside of Australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders. Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this perception. The film itself reminded me of A Simple Plan. But as far a being one of the best Australian films ever, as someone claimed, I can t be that generous. Put it this way, I wouldn t bother watching it again.	0

The most difficult thing about this movie is to say anything positive about it. The characters were stereotypical  white trash , the movie s  plot  was stunted from the beginning, and the worst feature of this movie was that the nudity was so blatantly from body doubles it was funny. Regretfully, that was the only funny thing in the movie. Ms. Jenkins would be better served if in the future, she would refrain from using her life story to  entertain  people. It was simply that bad. The one positive aspect of this movie  this has nothing to do with the lack of quality of the film  is that my brother shelled out the money for this stinker.	0

Helix coil transition models are formalized techniques in statistical mechanics developed to describe conformations of linear polymers in solution. The models are usually but not exclusively applied to polypeptides as a measure of the relative fraction of the molecule in an alpha helix conformation versus turn or random coil. Most models contain parameters for the likelihood of helix nucleation from a coil region, and helix propagation along the sequence once nucleated  because polypeptides are directional and have distinct N terminal and C terminal ends, propagation parameters may differ in each direction.	2

This is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime. Cool title, excellent director  I saw  To Die For  and  Drugstore Cowboy  before this , and hey   Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you go wrong  Well, that is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after I watched this turkey. Disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat, this is a dead zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs. Its critical lambasting was well deserved. You have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality. Zero out of     .	0
Sharon Lee Blythe was born in Kansas City in 1941. Daughter of William Jefferson Blythe, Jr., she is most notably former U.S. President Bill Clinton s half sister. In 1993, Clinton, while still in office, received information confirming news stories about his father s daughter.

Sharon Pettijohn, as she was known in 1993, sent the White House copies of her birth certificate, her parents  marriage license, a photo of Bill Clinton s father, and a letter to her mother written by William Jefferson Blythe, Jr., himself. This provided conclusive proof of her relation to the former President. As of publishing  My Life  in 2004 Bill and Sharon had not meet in person.	2

We jump from Voodoo to DEATH 1 THE HARMFUL AGENT BRINING People BACK TO LIFE. Whatever, this movie isn t worth the  1.00 it cost to rent it.

Rather than watching this movie, I should have had a root canal. The cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship   funding. This movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is exhibited by Mormons when they play church sanctioned basketball, however because it s rated PG, the true nature of the spectacle could not be transfered to film. The acting is horrible with the exception of Clint Howard and Fred Willard. Thurl Bailey s appearance in the film was completely unnecessary.	0

It is simply disgusting and irksome. In addition to foolish plot, sense of humor, there is something else. The way the rooms are decorated, the colors. It makes me sick, everything is so colourful that it might cause epilepsy. Usually I do not care about the decoration in movie but this from  Free Money  made me angry.

Director Ron Atkins is certifiably insane. This ultra low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one Harry Russo  John Giancaspro, who also co wrote , a nut job who receives a Rubberneck doll from his bitch girlfriend. He starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What starts off as being a balls to the wall exploitation film, well stays like that, but it gets VERY repetitive VERY fast. I m leaning more toward the certifiably insane. It IS hard to forget once seen though. Kinda like if Tom Green ever did a horror film.

I am at a distinct disadvantage here. I have not seen the first two movies in this series, although I have seen a lot of Larry Cohen films. Fans of the series seem to think this is a good film. Judging it on it s own, it was pretty boring. You never get a real good look at the maniac cop s  Robert Z Dar  face, but what I did see was pretty grim. The death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film, not to give any thrills. Maybe if I saw the NC 17 Director s Cut, I may be more impressed. The ending with the car chase with Z Dar, Caitlin Dulany, and Robert Davi was pretty intense. best part of the movie.	0

I wanted to like this movie, but many elements ruined it for me. The use of a fisheye lens throughout and choppy editing did not give me a sense of being in the world of the meth head, but it did make me think I was watching MTV for a few short moments. The movie never did seem to go anywhere and the acting was truly an excellent example of over acting. I love movies that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld, but this film couldn t decide if it was a bad horror film or an even worse serious commentary on the horrors of addiction.	0

Jane Russell proved to be a delightful musical comedy performer in the similarly titled  Gentlemen Prefer Blondes  but, sadly, this film squanders those skills. There is a budget, and nice Paris photography, but the film just doesn t work. Ms. Russell seems to be playing Marilyn Monroe. That leaves nobody to adequately play Jane Russell. Some of the other players are WAY out of their element. There are several embarrassing scenes  most of all, be warned  there is a musical number where boneheaded African cannibals  cook  the brunettes in a pot, after Alan Young sings in a gorilla suit.

The mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the 80 s well with some good performances. However..... The script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where I expect it was intended to be edgy. The characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clich  s that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is this movie has no real story. It ticks all the right  arty  boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was. Very disappointing	0

Despite being a 2001 movie, the direction is the kind of 90 s art house style that was considered  old  and out of date a few years ago. The cheesy cuts and effects were painful to watch. The script is decent enough, and a few scenes did kind of captivate me  like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night . But the story line with the detective who s sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible. The performance by the actor who plays Selma Blair s married boyfriend seriously bothered me. I did sit through the whole thing, though, which is rare for the kind of random, what is this movie you just find on TV and decide to watch.	0

Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts to using vigilantism. She in essence nullifies the judicial system. The film  The Accused  was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins.

As a young black latina woman I am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course when I saw this movie at the video store I thought I would enjoy it  unfortunately, I didn t. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story was simply not properly developed. The movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film. Had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes, perhaps I would have enjoyed it a bit more. Honestly, I would recommend a film like  Raising Victor  over this one any day. I just was not too impressed.	0

Some nice car chase, shoot  em up, blow  em up action if ALL you want is action, because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best, and completely unbelievable. The motivations of the characters, especially that of Gooding s at the end, are worse then unbelievable, they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled.

Just saw this movie on TV and I have to admit, I was a bit surprised it was even on.

If you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script, check out  The Crew . There really are no redeeming factors here, and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime. I wanted to like it, but the shallow script cheats the audience, by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with.   MERK	0
This is just short of a full blown gore fest based on a Stephen King story. Two tabloid reporters, one seasoned Miguel Ferrer and one not so accomplished Julie Entwisle , begin to believe that a serial killer Michael H. Moss  may actually be a vampire. Stranger than odd is this modern day blood sucker does not wing his way naturally, but by way of a black Cessna he seeks his victims. The gore actually gets gruesome as the film nears its stupid finale. Keep in mind that Mr. King had nothing to do with this film. I do admit it is a bit scary in the wee hours of the night.	0

Direct cinema is a form of documentary film that emerged in the late 1950s and the 1960s. Its origin is often associated with the advent of lightweight cameras and transportable, synchronized sound recording devices, although this sort of technological determinism is somewhat controversial.  In fact,  writes Claire Johnston,  the lightweight camera crucially, not the portable sync sound unit was developed as early as the 1930s in Nazi Germany for propaganda purposes  the reason why it was not until the 1950s that it assumed common usage remains obscure. 	2
The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is bad film in every way. The script, the dreary pace, the lack of depth in any character, the pointless sub plots, the dreadful acting, the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film I ve ever seen. I found nothing likable, enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way. I imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark, with its moody lighting, long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack. If so, they failed utterly. It just bored me, and I wish I had never watched it. Avoid at all costs.	0

Durin s Tower and the top of the Stair were destroyed in that struggle.

This is a REAL problem that far too many Afican American families have dealt with and continue to deal with.

What was the purpose of advertising this subject matter and then copping out on the ending  Seemingly, television can deal with almost ANY subject matter EXCEPT RACE.

Wrong    If the casting director was intending to cast a  Jane  who was plain he certainly succeeded. However, surely he could have found one who could also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester  Where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere  Where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother  Finally, why was the plot changed at the end  One wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book.

The director Sidney J. Furie has created in Hollow Point a post modern absurdist masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience. Sidney J. Furie dares to ask the question of what happens to the tired conventional traditionalist paradigms of  plot  and  characterisation  when you remove the crutches of  motivation  and  reason . The result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not possibly get any higher. One and a half stars. P.S. Nothing in this movie makes any sense, the law enforcement agents are flat out unlikeable and the organised criminals are full on insane.	0

...the first film I had to walk out on. And it was the cast and crew pre screening  Not that I was involved, I hasten to add . I made it through the first hour, so I reckon I m just qualified to comment, but that was my limit. Like other comments here, how did this get through any kind of QA. An accumulation of the very worst in dialogue, the epitome of wooden acting, awful casting, all wrapped together without a plot. Tara Fitzgerald s casting was bizarre, almost comic. She possesses the worst Russian accent in movie history. As I left the screening, the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema. They obviously couldn t sit through it again either.	0

I thought this was a truly awful film  I found myself actually yelling at my tv a couple times. One or both of the gay male leads was miscast  there was absolutely no chemistry between them and Richard Ruccolo looked like he d rather be kissing a dog. The movie covers their long and tortured courtship, highlighting each break up and make up, but not developing the reasons in between in any detail. These reasons would make for some interesting characters, not the fight or the make up scene in bed  lame even if you liked the movie . Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine as their characters, but it doesn t make the film worth renting. Save your money.	0

This foolish, implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hard boiled police detective delivers some nearly audible lines confirming our greatest fears  He is dead. Perhaps the film would have been saved had the director forgone the dazzling star power of A. Martinez in favor of this sadly anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment. That a no name hack tor off the street could salvage such a dishwater film is no less likely than a villain committing murder by dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver. His moment is brief  his promise is immense. Perhaps we will be treated to more screen time by this obscure thespian if there is ever a sequel to this ill advised film.	0
Let me start out by saying that I used to really like Betty Grable, particularly from  Down Argentine Way , but by the time she got around to this disaster, she had also got  round  and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment. Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr  who must have been fairly desperate  the story was bad, the colours good, and the film far too long. It had some of the old standbys in it like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success. The music score was woeful, and I have to say not one tune was memorable in any way....as I was such a fan of Miss Grable, I always wish I had never seen this one 	0
The movie s premise is spooky  a woman gets pregnant when kissed by a stranger in a bar. But as soon as the movie begins, a horrible opening scene establishes that this is a C type Sci Fi TV movie. It s a big Star Trek and a bit X files, but more than anything else it s boring. When the movie kicks into action everything is predictable and cliche. It looked more like a 2 parter in a bad Sci Fi TV series. No suspense and no thrills, but not for a lack of trying. Just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters. Don t waste your time.	0

In linguistics, a quantized expression is such that, whenever it is true of some entity, it is not true of any proper subparts of that entity. Example  If something is an  apple , then no proper subpart of that thing is an  apple . If something is  water , then many of its subparts will also be  water . Hence,  apple  is quantized, while  water  is not. Quantization has proven relevant to the proper characterization of grammatical telicity  roughly, sentences that present events as bounded unbounded in time  and the mass count distinction for nouns. The notion was first applied to linguistic semantics by the logician Manfred Krifka.	2

I do regret that I have bought this series. I expected more action, more objective picture and more consistency. This is just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm, or romanticism, it is just boredom itself. I find the actors work quite weak as well. O Donnell might seem charming as Robin  with Batman , but in this picture he lacks any charm. Probably while he becomes older, he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up. It comes as no surprise, that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the UK for 40  of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands.	0

The worst movie I have seen in quite a while. Interesting first half with some engaging, terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late night bar. The movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock  read disgust  without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else. I wanted to walk out, but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect. Still, time is precious  as the director himself observed in his intro  and I really begrudge the time I wasted on the second half of this one. Saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie, especially the female lead.	0

The sketches are all way too long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost as they re all drawn out to the point of complete boredom.

...And I never thought a movie deserved to be awarded a 1  But this one is honestly the worst movie I ve ever watched. My wife picked it up because of the cast, but the storyline right since the DVD box seemed quite predictable. It is not a mystery, nor a juvenile catching film. It does not include any sensuality, if that s what the title could remotely have suggest any of you. This is just a total no no. Don t waste your time or money unless you feel like watching a bunch of youngsters in a as grown up kind of Gothic setting, where a killer is going after them.

From the pen of Richard Condon  The Manchurian Candidate 1962  comes this muddled tale of political intrigue and assassination. The story, told in almost comic book fashion is difficult to swallow.

It seems as though at times the story is actually mocking the more sincere effort put forth in  Manchurian Candidate.  A disappointment on all counts.	0

Blank Check is easily one of the worst films of the nineties. The plot is completely pointless  its overtones of lonliness are pathetic. Do you really believe a twelve year old acting as a personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish everything in this film, like buying a mansion for a mere  300 grand. The notion, let alone the bargain basement price, will only be believed by the most gullible viewers. Please, respect your intelligence and don t watch this awful, awful film.	0

Despite the excellent cast, this is an unremarkable film, especially from the aviation perspective. It may be somewhat better than the egregious  von Richthofen and Brown  but not by much.

I knew this film was supposed to be so bad it was funny, so I went into it with that expectation. I just found it to be so bad it was murderously boring. The whiny theme song is funny for about 10 seconds, until you realize there is nothing clever about it except its intentionally irritating quality. Seeing things get splattered with tomatoes gets old in about 30 seconds. There is just nothing clever or funny about the film except for the premise. It could sustain a 3 4 minute comedy sketch maybe, but this is just not a feature film by any stretch of the imagination.	0

The whole Biker Movie genre has to be made up of the worst films ever made.

What ever happened to Robert Walker, Jr.  At one point he was in some major studio productions, and then he just faded away. This movie really blows, but if you have not seen a Biker movie in a long time, it is a good one to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a bit trashy for having watched it 	0

Due to the difficulty and risks associated with permanently healing single surface piercings, most corset piercings are intended to be temporary in nature.	2
This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. The DVD was given to me free with an order I placed online for non DVD related items. No wonder they were given away, surely no one could part with money for this drivel. How some reviewers can say they found it hilarious beggars belief, the person who includes it in the worst five films ever has got it spot on. How on earth a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman could get involved in this rubbish is unbelievable. Mostly toilet humour and badly done at that. Anyone wanting to be entertained should avoid this at all costs.	0

The person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writer director star  or is, in fact, the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle. How about this  You want to make a movie  tell a story  entertain  draw me in with vivid characters. Sure, you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal. However, do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads. If I m to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy.	0

Up until this new season I have been a big  Little Mosque  fan. However, the new season had absolutely RUINED it. The new Christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show. It has always been about living together to overcome prejudice. The new vicar ruins that premise and shows Christians in a very bad light. I am neither Christian or Muslim, but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between Amar and the Reverend. Not any more. Just cancel it and be done with it. It s not worth watching any more. It might still be saved, but a lot of change would need to be made. Bring back the old format.	0

Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I have ever seen. They have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most easily offended viewers which for CBC means 85 year old farmers in Saskatchewan.

The performances are very hammy and over acted but I don t blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the CBC asked for and demanded. Very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as  controversial  well it is less controversial than the other boring CBC comedies like The Hour Has 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer s Report.	0

The Bagford Ballads were English ballads collected by John Bagford  1651   1716  for Robert Harley, first Earl of Oxford. Bagford was originally a cobbler, but he became a book collector in his later years, and he assembled this set of ballads from the materials he had been collecting. Harley was interested in all sorts of antiquarian literature, and the Harleian collection is a major contribution to scholarship. The Bagford Ballads are generally folk compositions that document the last years of the Stuart reign in the close of the 17th century  a subject that was not remote for Harley . After Harley s death, the Bagford Ballads were obtained by the Duke of Roxburge, and they were finally published at large by the Ballad Society in 1878.	2

Rural family drama  with perhaps a nod to  Ordinary People   concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. Despite downbeat subject matter  given mercilessly glum treatment by director Christopher Cain , there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience. What with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie is nearly a small scaled reunion of  The Natural . Too bad this project didn t get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping, memorable picture.  1 2 from     	0

I went to this movie expecting a concise movie relating the effect the Son of Sam had on the society. I didn t expect Spike Lee to force feed me more garbage on racial tension, mob justice, or the inability of the common citizen to make a choice under pressure by peers. Lee has presented an extreme opinion. The entire movie could have been more effective if in a 90 min format with more focus, less tangential sub plots. Don t even bother renting the video unless you passionately enjoy Spike Lee  in such a case, the theatre is worth it. This is not an escapist movie.	0

This was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there. But the casting decisions completely wrecked the movie. Hanks is a great actor to be sure, but lacks the smarmy, morally ambivalent characteristics needed for the lead role. Jeff Daniels would have been my choice. Putting Melanie Griffiths in, for eye candy reasons, is understandable, but again, she did not portray the depth or ambivalence, so need to pull this off.

My 7 year old daughter loved it, as Disney execs crassly calculated that she would. That s the problem with  Air Buddies.  It s a strictly by the numbers children s film filled with carefully calculated cuteness, a couple politically correct morals, and enough potty humor to avoid the dreaded G rating. As a parent, or even as a 10 year old, you ve seen it all before, and done better before. Think  101 Dalmatians Meets Home Alone  and you get the general idea. I m of the opinion that a good children s story is a good story, period.  Air Buddies,  which is about as original as recycled paper, fails to meet that standard. It isn t the worst video your child could watch, but there are megatons of better ones.	0

This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre I have seen. It is uncertain whether or not the writer of the screenplay ever read the book by Bronte. George C Scott is ridiculous and bumbling as Rochester  when not just plain old acting angry. Susannah York has the most dated 1970 s hairstyle I have ever seen in a Victorian movie. The characters hardly speak to each other, so the rich banter enjoyed in the book that is the basis for their deep intellectual and abiding love, is gone. The ending is ludicrous. Please, rent the Timothy Dalton version instead. It is so true to the book, it s like having the novel read aloud to you. Dalton is superb as Rochester. G. C. Scott is laughable.	0

I only watched this because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and featured Claudio Cassinelli, an actor I like. I was certainly disappointed. The idea that condemned prisoners would fight to the death for TV ratings has been overdone with Rollerball, Logan s Run, Blade Runner, and the new film, Death Race, which will certainly suck me in because it stars Jason Statham. This was just a bore for the most part. The  Kill Bike  action was ridiculous. The  training  was a snooze fest. It just never grabbed me and made me want to care about anyone, including  Dallas  star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. Pick one of the others mentioned and you ll be better off.	0

It s hard to criticize this movie, because I dislike the story itself, and no amount of good acting would have saved it. Think  Raising Arizona  with a mean streak. The acting is passable, but Jennifer Tilly is way over the top  yet not enough to make this a nice camp film  as usual, coming in somewhere between  Misery  and a sarcastic DMV employee. The rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation, either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise. A real degrading few hours of film. Darryl Hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood. I wish I could tell you how it ended but I walked out, sorry.	0

Bad plot  though good for a B movie , good fast paced fight scenes, at most a 5 out of 10. But something has always bothered me about this film  how come Mariska Hargitay never speaks  In the TV version, she shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in a garden. Yet in the regular  video  version, most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all. This bothers me because it not only takes out a female  though cliched  point of view to the film, it also makes the final shot seem creepy. This film would have been better had they kept her scenes in, because in those scenes at least she has a personality, one that undercuts whatever Speakman says.	0

This is a bad B movie masquerading as a mockumentary. The porn documentary filmmaker in the movie has almost as much screen time and dialog as any other character. That completely destroyed any  documentary feel  that they may have wanted to create. The fact that the film is not actually a mockumentary is the least of it s problems. The film is not funny. The film is not sexy. The film doesn t have anything insightful to say about the porn business. It s not even particularly salacious. While there s simulated sex, the amount of nudity is mild for an R rated film. Someday, someone will make a good mockumentary about the porn industry. This is not it.	0

This would be a watchable Hollywood mediocre if it had a good editing. It relies on the typical American thriller plot    who is going to outsmart everyone . Acting is below average, but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises. Film was completely suffocated by blank video and sound shots and most of it looks like raw film material. All in all, if you don t mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project, this is a film to watch. I guess that would be enough to say on this film, everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough.	0

I would say that I believe this show will be cancelled, but seeing as how ABC is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing, they might just keep this one simply because it s average compared to them.	0

What a crappy movie  The worst of the worst  This movie is as entertaining as a dead slug. No talent what so ever actors, stupid plot. Who wrote this script   Was there ever a script for this goofy movie or did the director just accidentally press the record button on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along  Is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what  My friends younger brother is in the 6.th grade and him and his classmates just did an amateur movie for their school project which outdid this geeky movie.. This is by far the worst film I have seen in my life  There is just no excuse for this flick 	0

The premise was intriguing, but sadly this film just doesn t do any justice to it. The casting was quite good, and it was shot beautifully   but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent  overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect.... I was waiting for Steven Bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial , characters were identified exclusively by on screen coke usage  and pretty much everything else left to Boogie Nights for character development , and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story.

Meatball Machine  has got to be one of the most complex ridiculous, awful and over exaggerated sci fi horror films that I have ever came across. It is about good against evil and a coming of age tale, with the aim of to entertain with bloody, sleazy and humorous context. Because of that the violence isn t particularly gruesome and it doesn t make you squirm, but the gratuitous bloodletting and nudity does run freely. The performances by Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka is the worst i have seen, if that was not enough it is also directed by an unheard of director called Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie just have it all, it is bad to the bone , A must see for every b movie freak   ... Simply  an enjoying and rare gem.	0

Whoever is giving this movie 10s is completely incorrect and should be disregarded. I am in no way connected to any of the other reviewers. Simply put, this movie is not worth watching.

Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.	0

Cast to die for in a movie that is considerably less. Vanessa Redgrave is dying but before she goes she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and of her secret love...

At first, three words  READ THE BOOK  Really guys   this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters. I loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film. It was ludicrous, with half a heart and the story bad explained. The novel   in the first place    wasn t meant to focus on an adventure  That s only the surroundings. In the film, the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat  Additional, the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious  They screwed it up ...I ll never watch it again 	0

I should have never watched this movie. The style of filming may be considered artsy to some, but it is considered migraine inducing to me. I think it may have had an interesting plot, but since I couldn t watch it for long stretches at a time I missed a lot. The flickering pictures and stop motion filming branded my brain. I stopped watching mid way through and won t be back for a second try. I suppose if I were home alone in my own lighthouse some dark and stormy evening, this might be just the ticket... PS Not sure if the lighthouse  film style thing can be considered a spoiler, but I don t want to be blacklisted on my first review   	0
The Sweet Home Valley of the South Santiam River runs from an area known as The Narrows near the western edge of the city of Sweet Home, Oregon to the confluence of the South Santiam and Middle Santiam rivers at Foster Reservoir on the east. Extending on either side of the South Santiam, nearly all of the valley south of the river is inside the city of Sweet Home while the valley north of the river remains unincorporated. Prior to the construction of Foster Dam, the area inundated by Foster Reservoir was occupied by several ranches and farms.	2

I found it a real task to sit through this film. The sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said. There was little to move the plot along and often the action simply stopped and there was a prolonged period of conversations which seemed extraneous to the movie. These conversations switched between family groups and the observer was left to try and piece together what the common thread was that tied them together. It is rare that I rate a film this low and do so in this case as the entire viewing experience left me thinking  so what  and  why did I waste my time watching this. 	0

E.J. Korvette was a New York City based retailer, founded in 1948. It is notable as one of the first department stores to challenge the suggested retail price provisions of anti discounting statutes. It is also notable for its failure to manage its business success which led to decline and its 1980 bankruptcy and closure. Founded by World War II veteran Eugene Ferkauf and his friend Joe Swillenberg  or Zwillenberg , E.J. Korvette did much to define the idea of a discount department store. It displaced earlier five and dime retailers and preceded later discount stores, like Wal Mart, and warehouse clubs such as Costco Wholesale.	2

I saw this director s  Woman On The Beach  and could not understand the good to great reviews. This film is much like that one, two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else. Like his other films, you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog, wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten, pretty uninteresting characters. If you feel you can like this film, don t let my review stop you. I do like minimalism in films, but I feel Tsai Ming Liang s films are far superior. He has a fairly terrific actor in Lee Kang Sheng in his films. There is nothing here. I wish IU liked it, but I don t. Oh, well.	0

This movie has some fatal flaws in it, how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is unbelievable. Then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the Dr. s office, is just bad writing or bad editing. Very very very predictable movie. I am not sure how this film got made, except it is was filmed in Canada, and probably received a government grant. I must say the person playing Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job. Unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television then I would say it will kill some time, but otherwise, it is a movie no actor would want on their resume.	0

I enjoyed the first reviewer s comment far more than I did the film when I saw it at a second run theatre in the early  80 s. I was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the Tenniel drawings. But to me, the cast was largely squandered, their personalities muffled by the masks, while the direction I think of as being unusually static, and the photography murky. The rating jotted down at the time was a nought, which means  not worth sitting through even once . Still, I too would jump at a chance to have a second look.	0

Novaculite is a form of chert or flint found in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma and in the Marathon Uplift of Texas. Novaculite is considered to be geosynclinal highly siliceous sediments and may be a product of the low grade metamorphism of chert beds. The strata were deposited in the Devonian Period and subjected to uplift and folding during the Ouachita orogeny of the Pennsylvanian Permian Periods. Novaculite is very resistant to erosion and the layers of novaculite stand out as ridges in the Ouachita Mountains.	2

Venkatesh Ketakar or V.B.Ketakar      Aug 1930  was an astronomer who lived in India. Almost forgotten now even in his native country, his claim to fame is that he correctly predicted some parameters of the orbit of Pluto   nearly 20 years before it was actually discovered by Clyde Tombaugh. Though Tombaugh was unaware of Ketakar s work, the latter s calculations for Pluto turned out to be much more correct than those of Percival Lowell and William Henry Pickering, who are still remembered for their significant contributions to astronomy. By the time Pluto was discovered in February 1930, Ketakar had suffered a severe paralytic stroke and died soon after.	2

In what could have been an otherwise run of the mill, mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties  the subtle  free love  period , the creators of this film pile on ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario and top it all off with a trite little cherry on top, happily ever after ending. At no time did I ever feel sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in their troublesome middle class care free life, nor did I feel for the emasculated Liev Shrieber. The story line plods along slowly to its predictable, pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and watchable about this film is the stunning Diane Lane topless. Here s a hint, it occurs about 30 minutes into the film. Fast forward to that part and skip the rest.	0

Poor Will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this horiible German TV adaptaion of his classic play. It s obvious that very little money was spent on it. A stage riser, a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set. The movie was ineptly dubbed into English, with the English voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines. The whole production had an incredibly dark and dreary feel to it. And just where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway  MST3K gave this sorry production the treatment it justly deserved.

OK, I am blessed. I have seen two very strong stage productions, the one in New York with the original cast, and another at the San Diego Rep  Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you rock  . Compared to either of these the movie is almost unwatchable. I ve been plodding through the DVD for the past two evenings and am still not finished. Way too much extraneous dialog, and waaay too many added scenes and people. Yes, the four major performances are quite good, esp. Ms. Streep s. But comparing stage to film is definitely an example of  less is more.  The thickening of the play to satisfy film goers  need for scenic variety and specificity was a poor choice. Please, please, please go find a stage production somewhere near you.	0

I cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie. The 1972 movie with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic. Steve McQueen was an outstanding actor and Baldwin is only an inadequate actor. He has no passion in his play.Also the action in the original  Getaway  was fantastic. But the remake has no action  It is almost boring despite the fact that the film making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. I don t understand the way that Baldwin imprisoned from Mexico. I think this is a mistake in the story. So i think that there was no need to remake it, or if they decided to remake a classic, they must choose an excellent actor for the first role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt...	0
Strange, almost all reviewers are highly positive about this movie.

The major flaw with the film is its uninspired script. It plods back and forth between vignettes of Bettie s story and re creations of the Klaw short films. While the Klaw re creations are well done, it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety. Page Richards, while not an amazing actress, does a decent job overall. And, at times, she does bear a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. Also of note is some faithful attention to detail. Costumes and clothing well done, as is some of the set direction. The sets are generally sparse and feel stage y, but do feel of the era. It is sometimes surprisingly well lit, and the color palette was clearly thought out to give the overall look a vibrant, retro feel.	0

The old axiom that bored people are boring people is well demonstrated in  Women in Love.  The script, taken from D. H. Lawrence s novel, contains an endless flow of concepts that are, at best, sophomoric. What a pity so much effort went into so vacuous an exercise  what an empty array of characters given such attention. In spite of high production values, this film comes across as tedious as its personnel. A revisit in 2001 merely confirms a 1969 impression of juvenille minds in adult bodies, dawdling nowhere, and fumbling every step of the way.	0

Beautifully photographed and ably acted, generally, but the writing is very slipshod. There are scenes of such unbelievability that there is no joy in the watching. The fact that the young lover has a twin brother, for instance, is so contrived that I groaned out loud. And the  emotion light bulb connection  seems gimmicky, too. I don t know, though. If you have a few glasses of wine and feel like relaxing with something pretty to look at with a few flaccid comedic scenes, this is a pretty good movie. No major effort on the part of the viewer required. But Italian film, especially Italian comedy, is usually much, much better than this.	0

Mary Pickford becomes the chieftain of a Scottish clan after the death of her father, and then has a romance. As fellow commenter Snow Leopard said, the film is rather episodic to begin. Some of it is amusing, such as Pickford whipping her clansmen to church, while some of it is just there. All in all, the story is weak, especially the recycled, contrived romance plot line and its climax. The transfer is so dark it s difficult to appreciate the scenery, but even accounting for that, this doesn t appear to be director Maurice Tourneur s best work. Pickford and Tourneur collaborated once more in the somewhat more accessible  The Poor Little Rich Girl,  typecasting Pickford as a child character.	0

This is the biggest load of crap that I have seen in a long time. The last time I hated a movie so much was whilst watching  28 Days later  and  Magnolia . There is absolutely no point to this movie, except to see some really sick and twisted sex rape scenes, Gillian Anderson relieving herself on the side of the road, and every single sentence of dialog having to use the  F  word at least a couple of times in it. It has extremely cheap acting and is very low budget. My friend and I eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour. We had tried to give it a chance, but nothing could save this crud.

The law was named after Laura Wilcox and was modeled on Kendra s Law, a similar statute enacted in New York. The measure was passed by the California legislature in 2002, and signed into law by then Governor Grey Davis. Enforcement of the statute can only take place in counties that choose to enact outpatient commitment programs based on the measure  as of 2004, only one county had chosen to do so, on a limited basis .	2
Spinal Tap was funny because if you knew a little about heavy metal, you saw in jokes all over the place. If you know anything about porn, this mock documentary will leave you cold. Everything in it rings false. Spinal Tap was funny because it took a familiar world and pushed it over the top. This film is decidedly not funny because it paints a picture of how porn is made that bears no relationship to the real world. The acting here is uniformly awful, but that would not matter much if the core idea of the movie were good. But it s not.	0

Gojushiho Sho  Japanese  54 Steps Minor  is the minor form of a kata practiced in Shotokan karate, which has its origin in the Phoenix Eye style. Its name derives either from the repetitive movements of a woodpecker pecking a tree trunk, or from the staggering and hesitant steps of a drunken man. The advantage of the two versions of the kata is to better master the difficult techniques presented therein, but not without facing some confusion, for many sequences are the same and others only slightly different. The embusen of both Gojushiho dai and Gojushiho Sho are nearly identical. However, the latter kata begins straight off with a wide variety of advanced techniques and, as such, is highly recommended for study.	2

Martino and, not far away, the beautiful ruins of the Romanesque abbey church of S. Stefano in Manciano. The frazione extends several kilometers further to the NE into the Appennine range and the hamlet of Ponze at 904 m  2966 ft  altitude, with one more medieval church and a good view of central Umbria.	2

The final film for Ernst Lubitsch, completed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch s untimely death during production, is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness, romance and music, fantasy and costume dramatics. In a 19th century castle in Southeastern Europe, a Countess falls for her sworn enemy, the leader of the Hungarian revolt  she s aided by her ancestor, whose painted image magically comes to life. Betty Grable, in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers, has never been more beautiful, and her songs are very pleasant.

Take away the fact that the movie has no historical truth it, and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store. It is not even good enough to be called a B rated movie. Do not waste your money or your time on this movie. Just listing to the voice over and the horrible music made me sick. Anyone involved with this movie should be pulled from the union, gives the industry a black mark, but after watching most of this movie I really don t think anyone involved is a union member.	0

Movies like these are to the originals what Album Oriented Rock stations are to what music used to be like   repetitive, boring, and drained of all the original energy by a committee of corporate drones.

Go back and watch the 1971 version, count the things that would NEVER be included in a modern version, and thank whatever deity you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls to write and shoot an original concept movie that wasn t based on someone else s ideas, and wasn t passed through a corporate board before it saw the light of day.	0

Watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of Sandler. Truly a slow and painful death.  Bought the DVD in the  5.88 bin at Wal Mart. But the thought that keeps echoing in my head is,  How can I get my money back   The most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat JUST DOES NOT SINK  Best constructive suggestion  Mystery Comedy Theatre. You know that show on the SciFi Channel in which some guy and his muppet machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks  Mystery Science Theatre . IMMEDIATELY, spin off a comedy program and feature this flick. Without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck, I fear that viewers may actually begin following Sandler with ice picks and chainsaws.	0

My life is about saving animals. I do volunteer work with a cat rescue organization. I am a vegetarian because I couldn t kill an animal even to sustain my life.

It simply convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance. The ending   the foster parents adopt Sooner   does not redeem the depiction of animal cruelty.

If you re a bad movie fan like I am, this is great material. If, however, you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot, acting ability, or movie making skill, this is best avoided. The best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fast forward. Hilariously bad.

Funny moments  When the fake skull rolls out of a pile of ashes, the wife becomes hysterical and woozy while the husband  who is trying to drive the wife crazy  says in a deadpan voice  There is no skull there, there s no skull.  When the real ghost skulls have the husband caught in a pickle, as if trapped between first and second base.	0

Anyway, the film is fun for a while, but eventually the silliness and the pointlessness reign supreme.

This is one of those films that I could only sit through once. Charlotte Henry is fine  in fact, all the actors were fine. The problem was in the script, the dialog, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. Granted, this was 1933, but it really creaked. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable  there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming . The movie just clumped along with no cohesion. Much of Lewis Carrols spirit, humor and continuity are missing. What a pity  It s such a great book. I would recommend Disney s 1951 version.	0

If it wasn t for the bad dialogues and script. I mean, the direction was really in touch with it s subject. The actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life. But in the end, the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together. I would highly suggest not to watch this. Unless you re a Al Pacino enthusiast like I am and will watch everything he is playing in. Even if the result lately are rather poor. This is, after S1m0ne, a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles.	0

Later, said mods boys pelt mod girls with...vegetables  If you ignore  or fast forward  through the mummy s rambling, the shorts aren t bad in their own right. I found a few of them rather funny. My personal favorite is one where the sexually confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his pet lizard sits on the bed. This is one, well, bizarre movie.	0

I just finished a marathon of this series, and it became agonising to watch as it progressed. From the fictionalising of the historical elements, to O Herlihy s awful accent in later episodes, the show just slumps the further it goes. If you are looking for some low quality production generalised WW2 fluff, then I could recommend season 1, but avoid anything after that, it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera, with increasingly worse story lines and sensibility. The old B W film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the Colditz name attached to it, and even that is not what one could hope for.	0

Sculpey  often misspelled as Sculpy  is the brand name for a type of polymer clay that can be molded and put into a conventional oven to harden, as opposed to typical modelling clays, which require a much hotter oven, such as a kiln. Until it is baked, Sculpey has a consistency somewhat like Plasticine. It is sold in many colors, though it can also be painted once fired. It has become popular with modelling artists, the professional version super sculpey and was used in the production of the The Lord of the Rings movies to sculpt test armor and the character Gollum. It is also sometimes used for claymation. Sculpey closely resembles the better known FIMO, another brand of polymer clay.	2

Well...this is bad filmed as that of Border in early 1997...and director and writer just tried to overcome a shame of defeat in Kargil by Pakistani armed forces, by creating films like these.. One thing is very clear...Whenever there will be an encounter between Pakistan and India....we will win....    So Mr. Dutta try to make some good movies instead of Nonsense movies like this	0

What s the point of reviewing a movie like this  It s painfully and embarrassingly bad, not even in a way that allows you to make fun of it. Movies like  Little Man  depress me. They represent film at its most disposable. This movie was made for a bunch of 18 24 year old dipsh t frat boys who the studio was hoping would come out and see it on opening night before word leaked out about how bad it was, so that the film could quickly recoup its investment. A hundred other filmmakers with great ideas probably couldn t get their films made because resources were going toward making this puddle of vomit. Grade  F	0
It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive  maffia like  character of Russians, or at least of those Russians able to travel outside their big country  that it is too easy to rob a bank in England  and that British police is so inefficient that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and the supposed Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere, probably spoken by Aliens in the Ural mountains, but far to be the Russian one. So Nicole, if you really want to talk Russian, kindly go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep yourself busy learning Russian language grammar and its pronunciation.	0
Follow up to 1973 s  Walking Tall  continues the real life drama surrounding Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, but this installment plays like a lame TV movie. Bo Svenson takes over the lead role from Joe Don Baker, but he s much too mild for the part  he comes off like an ambling country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. Good supporting actors like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui end up with very little to do. I would give the film one star strictly on its good intentions, but the screenplay is a transparent and lazy mass of routine predicaments and the production is cheapjack. Followed in 1977 by  Final Chapter Walking Tall  and in 1978 by the television film  A Real American Hero .	0

A spinning newspaper is frequently shown in television and movies and is used as a transition device. At the conclusion of a story arc an image of a rapidly spinning newspaper will be displayed. The newspaper will then stop spinning and reveal a headline that reflects what happened between to the story arcs in the story, preparing the audience for the scene that follows. The spinning newspaper is considered an overused clich by many people and has been lampooned in shows such as The Simpsons and Robot Chicken where spinning newspapers that have headlines about spinning newspapers have been shown.	2

Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor  as if BOOGIE NIGHTS wasn t proof enough . I was embarrassed for genuine talents such as Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. No doubt their paychecks motivated them since it couldn t possibly have been the cliche ridden screenplay. I rented this DVD on a special  1 night and I still feel ripped off.	0

In cryptography, the term ciphertext expansion refers to the length increase of a message when it is encrypted. Many modern cryptosystems cause some degree of expansion during the encryption process, for instance when the resulting ciphertext must include a message unique Initialization Vector  IV . Probabilistic encryption schemes cause ciphertext expansion, as the set of possible ciphertexts is necessarily greater than the set of input plaintexts. Certain schemes, such as Cocks Identity Based Encryption, or the Goldwasser Micali cryptosystem result in ciphertexts hundreds or thousands of times longer than the plaintext.	2

Wow. Some movies just leave me speechless. This was undeniably one of those movies. When I left the theatre, not a single word came to my mouth. All I had was an incredible urge to slam my head against the theatre wall to help me forget about the last hour and a half. Unfortunately, it didn t work. Honestly, this movie has nothing to recommend. The humor was at the first grade level, at best, the acting was overly silly, and the plot was astronomically far fetched. I hearby pledge never to see an other movie starring Chris Kattan or any other cast member of SNL.	0

and a 30,000  budget and this movie still looks like it was made for 50 . You can tell from the first frame to the last that he didn t care one bit about the movies continuity or plot, he was just happy to be making a zombie movie. What the end result shows is a lazy film maker who loves zombie movies. It could have been great if he just had of given a care. The end result is endless zoom ins on poorly done gore, and even more poorly produced metal plays over it. What happens when you combine high hopes, big dreams, a decent budget, hard work, and one idiot behind the camera.	0

The small California town of Diablo is plagued with mysterious deaths after sheriff Robert Lopez unearths an ancient box.Legend has it that the box holds the sixteenth century Mexican demon named Azar.FBI agent Gil Vega is sent to investigate the murders and joins forces with the sheriff s daughters,Dominique and Mary to fight with evil and bloodthirsty demon. The Legend of Diablo  is an absolute garbage.The film lacks scares and gore,the acting is amateurish and the direction is bad.The animation is the only one aspect of the film I enjoyed.I m a big fan of indie horror flicks,for example I loved  Torched , Live Feed , Bone Sickness  or  Neighborhood Watch ,unfortunately  The Legend of Diablo  is a huge misfire.Definitely one to avoid.	0

Even worse than the worst David Lynch  confusathon ,  Brain Dead  makes no sense whatsoever. Shamefully wasted talent  Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton , bounce around like they are in a  Tom and Jerry  cartoon on acid. There is negligible character development. It simply starts climbing the  strange scale , until climaxing in total chaos. Do not get sucked into this because of the above fine actors. They are given nothing to work with, and you will be wondering what s going on throughout the entire, unbearable 85 minutes. I highly recommend avoiding  Brain Dead  at all costs, unless you are into scattering your brain into total nonsense.   MERK	0

The social commentary was way overblown and the mystery itself is built and solved through a series of implausible coincidences that were entirely unbelievable. Nothing has changed in Fitz s personal life in the past decade that makes it remotely interesting. I even had trouble understanding why he was complaining about his stay in Australia as compared to the opportunities to solve mysteries that he has in England. Can he not insinuate himself on the Australian police  It seems like a very artificial plot point to get him involved in a crime investigation. The latter episodes of the original series were pretty melodramatic and implausible, sometimes bordering on silliness, and this one picks up that mantle rather than returning to the focus of series one.

I only watched this movie because I was so impressed with Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But this is no SWAT. SWAT had a plot and some likable characters and made sense. Bullfighter had none of these.

Another called it the worst movie ever. Both gave the movie far too much credit. I am so glad I got it from the library for free, yet I still feel ripped off.

Its almost as if the corporate execs didn t like the low key down note ending and wanted to jazz it up. They failed and rather spoilt everything. Lets hope this is not a trend for the future.

Carboxypeptidase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes the first peptide or amide bond at the carboxyl or C terminal end of proteins and peptides. There are a number of carboxypeptidases in humans and throughout the animal and plant kingdoms. Different members of this diverse class of enzymes play many important biological roles. The first carboxypeptidases studied were those involved in the digestion of food  pancreatic carboxypeptidases A1, A2, and B . However, most of the known carboxypeptidases do not perform this function but instead play very specific roles, often in the production or regulation of biologically active molecules. For example, the biosynthesis of neuroendocrine peptides such as insulin requires a carboxypeptidase.

Papantzin was an Aztec princess and sister of Moctezuma II. In 1509, she fell seriously ill and became comatose. The Aztecs laid in a tomb, believing she was dead, but almost immediately, she cried out to be released. She related a dream, in which a luminous being led her to the shore of the boundless ocean, and several large ships appeared with black crosses on their sails similar to that on her guide s forehead. The princess was informed that the men in the ships came from a distant land and would conquer the country and bring a knowledge of the true God. Moctezuma read the doom of his empire in this.	2

I agree with the last reviewer that this movie had terrible acting. Yes, there was a lot of gore and some nudity. But it was overshadowed by a slow moving, meaningless plot and dumb ending. Where was this supposed to be filmed anyway  a Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong  Hostel was a much better movie and I would recommend seeing that instead. A technical annoyance I had with the DVD is that if you shut off the Spanish subtitles, they return after a few scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again. Also, don t waste your time on the deleted scenes because there s no audio and it just looks like tourist footage.	0

Hak Hap , or  Black Mask   in english  was a disappointment. I was told that it was a sort of  Japanese version of the Matrix . Imagine my disappointment. The film was either badly dubbed or the soundtrack didn t time well with the film. Another thing is that the dialogue was pretty much bad. There was very little thought put into the English version of this film and it appeals only to the  senseless action  genre. Not a film I would want to see again.	0

This film is a twisted nonsense of a movie, set in Japan about a dysfunctional family who end up with a strange violent guest who just sits back and watches the 4 members of the family at their worst. Nothing is sacred in this movie, with sex drugs and violence stretched to such a limit i m surprised it got past the censors. Overall, i think it will appeal only to those whom we shouldn t be encouraging, rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider. A film that panders to the worst element in society and is in anyway utter gash... A disappointment from a man who made the sublime Dead or Alive and Audition movies.	0

Although this isn t a  great film,  there s something compelling and memorable about it. Like another commenter on the film, I saw this in childhood. It s been thirty three years since 1952, but I have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title. See it if you have the opportunity. You ll feel like a voyeur of small town life as it evolves through the decades. More than any other film, this one brings a human face to the historical drama of early twentieth century  progress.  It s engaging enough for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one. Furthermore, it s easy to like the characters and watch their passage through time.	0

While the acting and directing could be argued as having some merit   the storyline is a very poor wannabe Vietnam movie with the country name simply changed. At the very least, for a movie to hold some credibility, try and have some semblance of accuracy in equipment, weapons and tactics. Nevermind the gross misrepresentation of the behaviour of the troops as a norm. Aside for the limited use as silly propaganda about the South African Defence Force, it serves little purpose   definitely no entertainment value. Aspiring movie makers   this is how not to make a war movie. Do some research, and have some pride in your product.	0

Wire wheels, a.k.a. laced wheels, is a term primarily used in the context of motorcycles. Nearly all bicycle wheels have spokes, and so the term wire construction type is assumed. A wire wheel has a central hub connected to the rim of the wheel via spokes made of wire. These spokes are generally quite solid and will not easily bend as would typical wire cord. Nevertheless, they mechanically function as wires under tension, holding the rim true and providing strength to the wheel. The process of assembling wire wheels is called wheelbuilding.	2

Take that with simplistic asides to make sure the audience still understand what s going on  the scene where Denzel Washington explains to a radio repairman how he must be like Scotty in Star Trek is nothing more than a joke  and you have a dumbed down thriller not worthy of the acting. Let us just hope that the real nuclear US Navy is not in the hands of such a script 	0

Grain refinement is a set of techniques used in metallurgy to ensure that the crystallites  grains  that make up a metallic object are sufficiently small, so as to increase its strength. One common technique is to induce a very small fraction of the melt to solidify at a much higher temperature than the rest  this will generate seed crystals that act as a template when the rest of the material falls to its  lower  melting temperature and begins to solidify. Since a huge number of minuscule seed crystals are present, a nearly equal number of crystallites result, and the size of any one grain is limited.	2

The plot doesn t offer any new excitements, it even starts the same as cube I. This time there are no other enhancements for the cube machinery, except for having an extra exit, which is not guarded, very ingenious. The characters are also not so well elaborated as in the first episode, they just became  flat  as in a soap opera. If somebody makes it to the normal exit, the person would be asked some questions, like  do you believe in god  , its not really creative or original and especially in my opinion it doesn t fit into the mystery of the cube with it traps.

This film concerns purportedly non establishment types  aesthetically and sexually  who apparently cannot resist basic romantic needs. Although some excellent players take part, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant, and Cynthia Nixon, they are grounded by a puerile script which relies nearly totally upon clever dialogue  which isn t. Nixon s role possesses the best lines, but she often homes in on them too quickly, a timing flaw which must be saddled upon the director. The grotesque climax utilizes every available cliche, spent or not, and fittingly ends this drab attempt at comedy.	0

Normally I m not motivated to write reviews. But this movie was so excruciatingly painful I feel I must. I cringed at the appallingly predictable plot, the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense. Indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the  most tense  moment of the movie. Molly Ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production. Even the  twist  at the end wasn t. I ve heard it said that the movie didn t take itself seriously  but I could find little evidence of that in the movie.

A good deal of running around. A badly conceived adversary with very little complexity. A scientist who works in communications sending off signals into space and receiving them, gets caught up with aliens. Along with his pretty wife, he invades their territory and is given secrets about them. He becomes rather traitorous in the process. Granted, he is given little choice anyway. There is a scene where he gives them everything they want. This is a dull movie with lots of long stretches where little happens. The plot isn t technically bad. It s just that we are usually following a car, a trip through a woods, investigating a building. This is what editing is all about. I suppose the story wouldn t technically support much more. Not much here.	0

Sujata Nahar was born in Calcutta in 1925, and spent her formative years near the poet Rabindranath Tagore. At the age seven she lost her mother. Her father, searching for another meaning to life, turned to Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. In this way Sujata also came to Sri Aurobindo in 1935, at age nine. She received private tutoring, and became secretary to Pavitra, the Mother s main disciple. She met Satprem in 1954. Later, the Mother entrusted her with the typing up of her private conversations with Satprem, which later became The Agenda. From 1965 to 1973 Sujata regularly accompanied Satprem to his meetings with Mother.	2

I concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie. Very poor acting, offhand production values, utterly pedestrian direction, and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written, let alone produced. Even Hollywood  professionals  apparently go to work just for a paycheck, although no one should have been paid for this bad work. Careers should instead have ENDED over this inconsequential drivel. OTH, there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw droppingly bad. And Chad Lowe is terrifically and consistently bad.	0

In fact, it never was. I m not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy. What a vacuous shambles  None of these people come close to a Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc, and anyway, today s audience isn t as receptive to this facile muck. Writing is trivial. The hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious. The chemistry between the leading characters is non existent. It s interesting that Julia Roberts seems to think she s a reincarnation of some big star from the  golden age of Hollywood , whenever that may be. It s an effect she tries and fails to attain yet again with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride.	0
This sleek, sexy movie is a must see. Only upon multiple viewings can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film. Personally I enjoy the narrator for his intelligent, no subject left untouched, style of narration. The introduction grips you right away, and holds you at the edge of your seat throughout the film. He provides wonderful insight into the world of the trainables and allows the audience to really  connect  with internal horror this film exhibits. The script itself holds the movie together wonderfully. Not only for kids, but the elderly alike will gain a higher understanding of the trainables and the modern grasp that they have on the sexual experience. Ahead of its time and groundbreaking in cinematography, it surely defines the word  masterpiece .	0

The first point that calls the attention in  For Ever Mozart  is the absence of a plot summary in IMDb.

Auslese  literal meaning   selected harvest  Plural Auslesen  is a German wine term for a late harvest wine and is a riper category than Sptlese in the QmP category of the Austrian and German wine classification. The grapes are picked from selected very ripe bunches in the autumn  late November early December , and have to be hand picked. Generally Auslese wine can be made in only the best harvest years that have been sufficiently warm. A small proportion of the grapes may be affected by noble rot in some regions although this never dominates the character of the wine. Rheingau winemaker Schloss Johannisberg is generally credited with discovering Auslese wine in 1787.	2

This film is quite boring. There are snippets of naked flesh tossed around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake but they don t succeed. The best thing about the movie is Lena Olin  she does a masterful job handling her character, but Day Lewis garbles most of his lines. Kaufman clearly had no idea how to film this. The incongruities in bouncing between domestic household marriage issues and political crises are badly matched. Character attitudes change without explanation throughout. Badly disjointed.	0

Yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wondrous special effects falling right into the trash can. Boring direction and performances  with the exception of the lovely Annabel Schofield who is much cuter as a brunette and probably deserves better material, and the ever earnest Charlton Heston  earn the rating of a real stinker. It s amazing to watch Heston perform up to his usual par and display how really bad this movie is. He even plays in a sub plot that kept me interested just to see how it tied back into the main line of the movie. The way they ended up resolving it was that they didn t. It simply falls off the end. Really. Don t waste your time on this one.	0

Wendy Wu  Homecoming Warrior has a very good, strong plot but is ruined by cheesy details throughout the movie. I am a younger teenager and didn t enjoy this movie very much. I thought the effects were horrible, but they might seem entertaining to younger children. The matrix moves ruined the action, you know that it was absolutely fake. Then there was the Yen Lo, an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming in which Wendy was striving to win. It all ends like a typical feel good movie when Wendy and her Buddhist monk cousin Shen defeat Yen Lo  and destroy him forever  in the end. So Wendy learns a lesson...blah, blah, blah. I m ready for the next DCOM.	0

This is yet another depressing and boring film about AIDS and tragedy. It begins very uneventful and predictable and continues throughout the movie. I kept waiting for it to pick up, but unfortunately it never did. The acting is fair, but the script needs A LOT of work. And if you re looking for the nudity, don t waste your time with these not so hot actors. Due to the poor sound quality and lack of captions, I missed 1 8 of the movie. If you have never seen over five gay films, or have recently come to terms with being gay, you may find this film interesting, otherwise it s your run of the mill low budget movie.

Something I really love about this woman s short films was the elusiveness of theme  especially in  Living with Happiness.  This film has some nice beginnings  unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment, but fails to succeed with clunky expositional dialogue, patchy performances and very television coverage. It s once again charming television and very ordinary cinema. The ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat like a television commercial. But the sentiment is good so we can t complain too much. I really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer who doesn t demand so much boring clarity.	0
If you enjoy seeing what must have started as a 2 hour movie in unconnected bursts of unwatchability, you ll love this film.

While the movie is slightly less than 1 hour and a half, I can only think of one truly memorable moment, and that is just before or during the credits 	0

The Second Renaissance, part 1 let s us show how the machines first revolted against the humans. It all starts of with a single case, in which the machines claim that they have a right to live as well, while the humans state a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything with they want. Although an interesting premise, the story gets really silly from then on with  violent   riots between the robots and mankind. Somehow it doesn t seem right, as another reviewer points it, it s all a little too clever. The animatrix stories that stay close to the core of the matrix  in particular Osiris  work for the best.

Germanic folklore is the lore and mythological culture of several European, and sometimes American, countries. It is the folklore of Germanic peoples from proto Germanic times to the modern age. It is sometimes incorrectly confined to Germanic paganism, that being the pre Christian religion of the Germanic world. However, folklore encompasses a much larger definition that just mythology  mythology is a subfield of folklore .	2
England, My England is the title of a collection of short stories by D. H. Lawrence. Individual items were originally written between 1913 and 1921, many of them against the background of World War I. Most of these versions were placed in magazines or periodicals. Ten were later selected and extensively revised by Lawrence for the England, My England volume. This was published on 24th October 1922 by Seltzer in the USA. The first English edition was published by Martin Secker in 1924.	2

I like to keep my reviews short and simple, but this pretty much sums it up. You cannot beat the original two for a number of reasons one of which including the directing talent of Chris Columbous. This movie had terrible directing covered up by even more terrible acting. I cant even believe these people are considered actors. Painful to sit through and watch. The storyline was a complete joke about a secret chip and Russian terrorists on a painstaking quest to get it back. Horrible, rent one of the original tow and enjoy yourself  The movie wasn t even set during Christmas like the original. Home Alone was turned from an excellent Christmas time family comedy movie to a joke with no moral or plot 	0

What an awful show. Science Fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality. It shocks me that something exceptional like Firefly lasts one season, while garbage like the Battlestar Galactica remake spawns a spin off. This spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show. The acting is juvenile and uninspired. The characters are cardboard clich  s of everything that has ever been in a bad Sci Fi series. The story is bad. The dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera. The direction is shoddy and the sets are awful. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a waste of effort. This is one spin off that should have never been made.	0

This documentary begins with an interesting premise  it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth. Sadly, though, after priming us with this, the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a non stop attack on Christianity, and pretty much focusing on the easy targets. The writer director clearly has some issues with the Church  he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legit anger  and this film seems to be his form of release. It d be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded, but as a whole, the movie is disappointing.	0

My spouse   I found this movie to be very schlocky. It started out good, but quickly got unbelievable   ridiculous. Most of the acting was poor, with the exception of the little girl, Abbie, who really was terrific. In addition, the dialog was predictable   lame   especially Gideon, the Angel s. Also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she almost appears nonchalant. At first we thought it was  shock , but then we realized that it was just a terrible script. We love almost all of the Hallmark movies   their heart warming stories, but this movie doesn t rise to the occasion of being one. There are so many great ones   don t waste your time with this horrible movie.	0

The crocodile is even worse, and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature, but the crocodile gets stuck and 2 females flash it.

I think scarecrows are creepy, so it s a pity this movie doesn t make more of them. A bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows. One of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows. The acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive  when they move . On the positive side, the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows. It is as Alfred Hitchcock says,  A bomb under a table goes off, and that s surprise. We know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off, and that s suspense. 	0

The characters were not developed at all, and there was no real cohesion in the plot which just seemed to go nowhere much. It s a shame really, as the premise for the movie was good and with better production quality, direction and script it could have been a decent movie. It certainly was not a comedy, unless you laugh out loud at the dubbing   which was amateurish, even the English actors sounded weird.	0

I don t enjoy many Lifetime movies but feel compelled to watch one every now and then in the interest of promoting harmony at home.

It is incredible that with all of the countless crimes that have been uncovered and laid unequivocally at the doorstep of Marxism, from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag archipelago to the Cultural Revolution to the Khmer Rouge, one still finds admirers of Communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and are still making propaganda in its favor. It just shows the moral depravity of Hollywood. In this particular film a psychotic murderer is glorified. Needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included. That both the director and the actor expect audiences to sit through this seemingly interminable propagandistic film demonstrates the tunnel vision that they have in regards to their object of worship.	0

I won t describe the story, as that has been done elsewhere. We are great Clive Owen fans, and when our Netflix recommended the movie, we were intrigued. No wonder we had never heard of this  movie , because it was a BBC Television movie back in 1992. Hence, the poor production values, grainy image, jerky camera work and poor sound. But, you don t really mind the mechanics, because the story itself will put you to sleep. It s an interesting human story, but not at all compelling, and there is hardly any ending. You don t really care for the characters as their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie. Save the two hours and do something to make the time more worthwhile.	0

The Laurel was the third English gold coin with a value of twenty shillings or one pound produced during the reign of King James I. It was named after the laurel that the king is portrayed as wearing on his head, but it is considerably poorer in both quality and style than the sovereign and Unite which preceded it. The coin was produced during James I s third coinage  1619 1625 , five different busts of the king being used in these years. All the coins were produced at the Tower Mint in London. The laurel weighed 140.5 grains or just under 0.3 troy ounce, less than the previous Unite but almost exactly the same as the Unite issued under Charles I.	2

I just finished watching this on TV and what can I say but this is the worst film I have EVER seen  I m embarrassed to be from Melbourne, where the film was made. Diabolical acting, amateurish makeup effects and a REALLY bad soundtrack. As for the plot, well, thats even MORE stupid  Some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was. There s a reason they put these types of films on late night TV   because they re utter rubbish  Avoid at all costs.	0

In New Zealand in the 1930s, farmers had trouble with exploding trousers as a result of attempts to wipe out the weed ragwort. Farmers had been spraying sodium chlorate, a government recommended weedkiller, onto the ragwort, and some of the spray had ended up on their clothes. Sodium chlorate is a strong oxidizing agent, and reacted with the organic fibres  i.e. the wool and the cotton  of the clothes. Reports had farmers  trousers variously smouldering and bursting into flame, particularly when exposed to heat or naked flames. One report had trousers that were hanging on a washing line starting to smoke.	2

I go to the cinema to be entertained. There is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film. From beginning to end, there is no respite from the gray, grinding reality of this woman s life. It is one paced, with no change of mood. I remained until the end only because I was convinced that things must get better. They don t, and I don t think I was the only one, as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close. Honestly depicting social depravation is no crime, but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public. A dreadful film.	0

Giant  is one of the most boring, overly long Hollywood contraptions ever. Many scenes seem utterly fake and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, and James Dean are wasted in this big Hollywood production. A central notion to this movie, that a rancher would ever resist drilling for oil on his land, is absurd, and I know this because I m from Houston. A couple of scenes, especially Dean serving Taylor coffee, redeem this otherwise boring film.

The best part of this film are some of the lines delivered by Lady Penelope which are highly comical. These provided some light relief for those expecting a rerun of the TV series. Having said that it passes 90 or so minutes in a  fun  way and so may just be worth watching.	0

Balloch Country Park features nature trails, guided walks, a walled garden, and picnic lawns with views of the Loch. It was originally developed in the early 19th century by John Buchanan, a partner in the Glasgow Ship Bank, and the gardens were significantly improved by the Dennistoun Browns, who bought the estate in 1851. Buchanan also built Balloch Castle, which now serves as the park s visitors  center.	2

Sarah Michelle Geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for sullying her good name with this movie. Shame on you Sarah for being associated with this horrible, horrible movie. Horrible movie, no need to ever see it.	0

This typically melodramatic Bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of Western critics. The script is ludicrous, the acting is over the top, and it looks cheesy. The only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by Mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary Meena Kumari. Watching the actress, who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released, has the same fascination as watching a train wreck. Her ex husband, Amrohi, wrote and directed, but lacks the competency to execute either task well. Bollywood has produced far better films.	0

I consider myself a  Roosevelt Democrat , but would appreciate a bit more subtlety. Of course, the problem could be with me. I see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this picture. Alas, not I. The only thing that kept me from giving this a  1  was the nice scenery, human and plant.	0

As a cinema fan White Noise was an utter disappointment, as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good, nicely lit, good camera work, reasonable direction. But as a film it just seamed as predictable as all the other  so called  horror movies that the market has recently been flooded with. Although it did have a little bit of the  chill factor  the whole concept of the E.V.O  Electronic Voice Phenomena  did not seem believable. This movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences but went ahead with them. The acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion, like many recent thriller horror movies. Definitely not a movie I will be buying on DVD and would not recommend anyone rushes out to see it.	0

Jude Law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value. Completely lacking in eroticism, excitement, or leading ladies with appeal. One decent fight, a few moments of mild suspense. And a one note plot. The movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between Law s character and a dogged homicide detective, well played by Timothy Spall. But despite their best efforts, both actors are staked to the cross of the film s banality. With a lesser actor in the lead role  and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis s cinematography  Crocodiles would blend into the sea of low budget vampire quickies.	0

This  screwy comedy  seems very forced. Indeed, the actors TRY very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script. And, as a result it doesn t really go anywhere. The idea of a woman finding out she was pregnant after getting a quickie divorce just isn t all that funny. And then, when Cooper sneaks off with the baby because he doesn t want it put up for adoption just seems terribly unfunny and it s really pushing hard to turn this into a comedy. It s really a shame, too, as the actors were more capable than the script and I found myself just bored by the whole mess. Considering that Cooper made so many GOOD comedies, I recommend you see them instead.	0

Unless you understand wretched excess this movie won t really mean much to you. An attempt was made to interject a bit of humanity into a cold and bleak period consumed by alcohol and drugs  it doesn t work. When Salma Hayak does her big disco number her voice is so obviously dubbed it is pathetic  the producers could at least have gotten someone that sounded remotely like her. The documentary that has been playing on television lately is far superior and gives a much truer view of that period of our history. No one, with the exception of Mikey Myers, could be accused of acting  however, he does an incredible job.	0
I looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented. I mean, I hate to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, tone it down a little.  Groundbreaking  is a little over the top. This is a Boston based college production that doesn t even achieve the level of most amateur college film. It s what you would expect a bunch of kids to do. A silly action film without much creativity. It s pretty funny if you re willing to poke fun at it. Not something you will ever see unless you are a student at Emerson college.	0

I couldn t believe my eyes once I ve watched this movie. There s no point in it either then blood and violence. Unlike other scary movies that had gore and a meaning to it this movie is just blood, gore, and killing one after another. This movie isn t interesting at all, has no meaningful plot or story line, nor does it have an intelligence in it. The blood looks very fake and this movie overall, is pointless. Don t even waste your time with it. It s just an hour or two of mindless violence. It has many bloody scenes that aren t scary but just plain revolting. This is probably the worst horror film I have ever watched out of all the horror films I ever saw.	0

A decent sequel, but does not pack the punch of the original. A murderous screenwriter Judd Nelson assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless killing, but movie seems very tongue in cheek. Any humor is not of the funny kind. Total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times Nelson is way over the top. This movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen...this should have happened to this script.	0

Constructed in the early 1990 s, the Leicester Western Bypass refers to a section of the A46, between the M1 motorway and Syston. The name refers to the fact that it allows traffic to bypass the west of the city, although it actually runs from north west of the city to the north east. The bypass is eight miles long, opened in November 1995, and cost 36m. It was thought the bypass was done on the cheap, but it made a significant difference to avoiding Leicester s roundabouts. In particular, traffic from outside the city to the north and west, and further afield even from the north east can gain access to the M1 southbound without having to travel along the city s outer ring road.	2

I gave this more than a 1 because I did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been beaten over the head with the God this, God that and Christ is our saviour stuff. The movie and the story line did not need it. If, as I am, you are a recovering Catholic or Christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous. The movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been.	0

This wasn t funny in 1972. It s not funny now. Unlike a lot of other people, I m not bashing the film because it is incredibly sexist   I quote enjoyed that bit, or rather I enjoyed the reaction it generates in annoying PC people   I m bashing it because it is poorly written and acted.

Antilapsarianism is the denial of the Jewish or Christian doctrine of the fall of humanity from his perfect physical and moral state in the Garden of Eden. Because antilapsarianism is implicit in evolution, by which the human species has steadily advanced, not declined, those who hold to theistic evolution often allegorize the Fall to symbolize humanity s alienation from close communion with God.	2

That is quite an outdated movie which aims to showcase the youth s yearning for freedom in some dehumanizing British school. Oh yes it s like in the army, you learn to obey and do what you re asked to. Yes the young dream of something else but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life. Great. Basically that s how you could sum up the nice intentions in If... Nice intentions that arouses no cinematographic challenges  the result is a declamatory movie. Do you see how boring I mean  At least that oldie helped Kubrick cast McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, a movie with a truly powerful social satire and no self indulgent sentimentalism.	0

This has the absolute worst performance from Robert Duval who sounds just like William Buckley throughout the entire film. His hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest. I m not sure if this was deliberate scene stealing or inadvertent but it s the only thing I can recall from a truly forgettable film. This picture should be shown in every amateur acting class of an example of what not to do. Thank God, Duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to effect a cultured accent. He is a good character actor but that s about it. Klaus is so much better. His performance is muted and noteworthy.	0

This movie was amusing at times, hell sometimes it was even downright funny. The underlying message I got from the film though, was that women are responsible for all of the troubles of man. Every time a woman is depicted in the film, she is being lazy, being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason. I don t think the message involved is good for women or gay men. But, it is a comedy, and a piece of art, so it is simply someones point of view. Even if I don t agree with it, they are still entitled to it. An amusing film, but some of the comments others have made are just plain stupid. Best film ever my foot.	0

This production has absolutely no storyline. The acting is embarrassing. The promising Dutch television Sophie Hilbrand star should not add this movie to her CV. Her acting is far from flawless and personally I think she has crossed boundary of professional decency  relating to the way she exposes herself in this movie. This movie contains too much unnecessary nudity, vulgar sexual scenes and rude language. It also shows a wrong image of the Netherlands  as most movies do . Do not bother to watch this movie  a waste of time, a waste of money and an embarrassing record for Hilbrand, who has proved to be better with her close on on the screen.	0

William Hogan was born in Ireland and became a priest before emigrating to America around 1810. Assigned to St. Mary s parish in Philadelphia, he proved himself a popular priest. But he soon ran afoul of Bishop Henry Conwell, who resented his popularity and disapproved of his vigorous social life. When Hogan resisted Conwell s attempts to rein him in, Conwell suspended him. The trustees of St. Mary s rushed to Hogan s defense and Conwell soon had a full blown schism on his hands. He eventually excommunicated Hogan in 1821 and then, like many American bishops in the 1820s, wrested control of the parish from the lay trustees.	2

Slow and nice images changed one another, with sometimes annoying music  you know Bjork  in background, for the first 75  of the movie. If you did not have enough sleep, that s a good time.

Stereotypical send up of slasher flicks falls far short as supposed entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby, and in fact the entire cast are totally wasted. Lame jokes abound, and every punch line is well telegraphed. The dumb one liners come at a fast pace, and almost every one falls flat as a squashed grape. The musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and lingers for the entire movie. Another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school.

I ll just be vague about my potential spoiling comments. There are enough canned plot elements in this movie that it s essentially pre spoiled. This movie derives a few ideas from a Southern classic, To Kill A Mockingbird. I suppose maybe TKOM got its ideas from some source.... at any rate, after you watch this, you ll say,  Oh yeah, that is a ripoff . I think the truly entertaining thing about these McMovies is once you ve identified a plot element, is to figure out whether they ll stick with the original, or try to twist it around. Not a lot of twists in this one.	0

Valentine is a horrible movie. This is what I thought of it  Acting  Very bad. Katherine Heigl cannot act. The other s weren t much better. Story  The story was okay, but it could have been more developed. This movie had the potential to be a great movie, but it failed. Music  Yes, some of the music was pretty cool. Originality  Not very original. The name  Paige Prescott  Recognize Prescott  Bottom Line  Don t see Valentine. It s a really stupid movie. 1 10	0

They Are Among Us  is poor science fiction at best. Mediocre acting bogs down this film. The plot holes are numerous. Aliens that somehow came to earth on a meteor and have been hiding among us for over 100 years, but need a plastic surgeon to make them appear human. In their alien form they supposedly have exo skeletons  which is why they need the plastic surgery  but when you see them they have teeth and fingernails. The heroine s father  disappeared  after Project Blue Book closed, but was supposedly an F 16 pilot. And on and on. If you want to see an alien invasion movie, pick  Invasion of the Body Snatchers , and see how it is done right.	0

As such, it was decided to move the discus throw and to hold the shot put at the ancient stadium, despite the fact that the shot put was not contested at the Ancient Olympic Games.	2

I had the misfortune to sit through the full 102 minutes of what, in my opinion, is this shockingly bad film. It fails on pretty much all levels  the cast is awful, the acting   ham at best and the plot lacks any depth, leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story lines. Plan B has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and I found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of comedy. A bona fide saccharine coated turd of a movie.	0

I mean, the script wasn t stellar to begin with, but the actors didn t make me believe the relationships. The plot is also predictable. Nonethelss, I liked it. The characters are likable, and the plot is not challenging or upsetting. It s sweet, the characters care about each other, and I don t count it as fifty minutes ill spent. But I don t recommend it.	0

With the heroine beautiful almost like Salma Hayek, hero fighting almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger..., music almost like in, say, Conan... etc. Almost. But in the end it s just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it. Maybe apart of John Rhys Davies flying in duel like those warriors in Hero or before mentioned Crouching Tiger... I am really ashamed of poor old John. He is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better. So as you   so if you still have a chance just watch something else.	0

A formal specification is a mathematical description of software or hardware that may be used to develop an implementation. It describes what the system should do, not  necessarily  how the system should do it. Given such a specification, it is possible to use formal verification techniques to demonstrate that a candidate system design is correct with respect to the specification. This has the advantage that incorrect candidate system designs can be revised before a major investment has been made in actually implementing the design. An alternative approach is to use provably correct refinement steps to transform a specification into a design, and ultimately into an actual implementation, that is correct by construction.	2

This is quite possibly the worst Christmas film ever. The plot is virtually non existent, the acting  Affleck in particular  is poor at best. Ben Affleck fans will probably defend this film but deep down they must agree. As far as I could gather the plot consisted of Ben Affleck, a millionaire salesman, is told by a shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood. On doing this he ends up paying the family currently living in the house to be his family for Christmas... and that is it. The film goes on and eventually he gets together with the daughter of the family.... blah blah blah.	0

Ashley Judd, in an early role and I think her first starring role, shows her real life rebellious nature in this slow moving feminist soap opera. Wow, is this a vehicle for political correctness and extreme Liberalism or what  Being a staunch feminist in real life, she must have cherished this script. No wonder Left Wing critic Roger Ebert loved this movie  it s right up his political alley, too. Unlike the reviewers here, I am glad Judd elevated herself from this moronic fluff to better roles in movies that entertained, not preached the heavy handed Liberal agenda.	0

It is a good film for kids who love dogs. It runs a bit slow early on but ends if a flurry of gooped up De Vil. The basic plot is the same as the first movie.

It is the comedy that the film needed more of. See it in the matinee so you don t have to pay full price or wait for it to appear on Disney.	0

Just don t bother. I thought I would see a movie with great supspense and action. But it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start. In the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed. Towards the end the it gets better but not really great. I think the director took this movie just too serious. In such a kind of a movie even if u don t care about the plot at least you want some nice action. I nearly dozed off in the middle main part of it. Rating 3 10. derboiler.	0

Positively awful George Sanders vehicle where he goes from being a thief to police czar. While Sanders was an excellent character actor, he was certainly no leading man and this film proves it. It is absolutely beyond stupidity. Gene Lockhart did provide some comic relief until a moment of anger led him to fire his gun with tragedy resulting. Sadly, George Sanders and co star Carol Landis committed suicide in real life. After making a film as deplorable as this, it is not shocking. The usual appealing Signe Hasso is really nothing here.	0

Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Imagine her at a friend s dinner party, and she adds a comment to the in depth political discussion going on. People just look at her and say,  Oh what would YOU know, you were the star of  Theodore Rex  . How could anyone take her seriously after she lowered herself to be the star of this appalling piece of crap  Even little kids would be cringing in horror at this Thing. It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of  Sigmund And The Sea Monsters . Actually, come to think of it,  Sigmund  was vastly superior to this.

The premise of this movie was decent enough, but with sub par acting, it was just bland and dull. SPOILERS The film does not work because of the nature of the death, it was accidental, so although it was a murder it wasn t like the guy set out to do it. Also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree. There is no emotion in this film. The first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister, and hearing her message. It was dull and boring. With some polishing, and better acting it could have been pretty good.	0

I would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash  There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you  The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn t even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad  And some people call this art 	0

It s like watching someone that pretends to be a doctor, throw non medical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility.

But the idea that the Soviet Union would agree to a TOTAL nuclear disarmament, because some apparatchik kids learned of a  silent protest  in the West, is ludicrous.

Quite average even by Monogram standards, this mystery  a remake of The Sphinx  has an oddball plot which is not unraveled to much effect  you ll see through it after about ten minutes. The two leads have some nice breezy dialog at the outset, but John Hamilton is hopelessly dull as the villain  perfectly cast Lionel Atwill originated the role  and Warren Hymer s nitwit shtick is pretty annoying. However, it s worth sitting through for a five minute appearance by the incomparable Mantan Moreland as Nicodemus the janitor, who gets the better of the defense attorney during a hilarious courtroom appearance.

This film is about a Japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on skin. The plot is absolutely bizarre. I fail to see any  sensual  or  erotic  undertones. The plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishistic pornography. In addition, the scenes that are filmed in Hong Kong are certainly portraying bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the middle of the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the whole film, I keep thinking that  The Pillow Book  is insulting the Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment.  The Pillow Book  is a perverted, yet boring film. Seriously stay away from it.	0

I don t think that the director and set manager could decide whether it was raining or not, because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other. I would rate this movie a 1 out of 10,  10 being the best, 1 being the worst . Also jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying, it makes you wonder if they were just making up for lose time. I beg anyone who reads this, NOT TO SEE IT.

David Morrissey is always good value and he Suranne Jones were good leads. The Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were tantalised with possible terrorist connections. But then Morrissey s character was killed off and all the air left the balloon. The last episode was dull, dull, dull. The whole thing turned out to be very small beer and the d  nouement was unbelievably feeble. Five hours of my life for that  My advice  watch paint dry instead.	0

In 1692 Salem, a devious child s lies about a slave s involvement in witchcraft sends an entire community into an uproar. Costume drama starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray isn t stuffy, though neither is it a vivid depiction of contagious hysteria. Worked on by three writers  Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead, and Bradley King , the story elements are rather interesting  especially coming out of Hollywood in 1937 , though to anyone who has since read Arthur Miller s  The Crucible , the hoked up melodrama on display here won t be tolerated for very long. Biggest problem with the picture may lie in the casting  Colbert and MacMurray are an ill matched pair of lovers hindered by the witch hunt, MacMurray being far too contemporary a presence for these surroundings.  1 2 from     	0

Meditations on First Philosophy  subtitled In which the existence of God and the real distinction of mind and body, are demonstrated  is a philosophical treatise written by Ren Descartes first published in Latin in 1641. The French translation was made by the Duke of Luynes with the supervision of Descartes and was published in 1647 with the title Mditations Metaphysiques. The original Latin title is Meditationes de prima philosophia, in qua Dei existentia et animae immortalitas demonstratur. The book is made up of six meditations, in which Descartes first discards all belief in things which are not absolutely certain, and then tries to establish what can be known for sure.	2

Rhynchokinesis is an ability possessed by some birds to flex their upper mandible. Rhynchokinesis is one of two types of cranial kinesis, the other being prokinesis, in which the upper mandible moves at the point where it is hinged with the bird s skull. Rhynchokinesis on the other hand involves flexing at a point some way along the mandible   either upwards, in which case the upper and lower mandibles diverge, resembling a yawn, or downwards, in which case the tips of the mandibles remain together while a gap opens up between them at their midpoint.	2
This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day. A wealthy upper class English woman schemes, plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. She uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly anti social kind. There s a clever sex role reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters. But naturally there s a tall, dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest, and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right man. The wishy washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme, but those who thirst for Romance will overlook that.	0

I picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of  Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom . Unfortunately I was in for a virtual yawn. Not like any yawn i have had before though. This yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie. The cover described amazing special effects. There were none. The movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully portrayed. It does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Good if you want to teach your kids that. I don t. Keep away from this one. If you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere.	0

The first American blues artist to really make an impact in New Zealand was Stevie Ray Vaughan in the early 1990s. Other blues related genres such as soul and gospel almost completely by passed New Zealand audiences, except for a handful of hits from cross over artists such as Ray Charles.	2

Post Normal Science is a concept developed by Silvio Funtowicz and Jerome Ravetz, attempting to characterise a methodology of inquiry that is appropriate for contemporary conditions. The typical case is when  facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent .

Now we have value driven policy decisions that are  hard  in various ways, for which the scientific inputs are irremediably  soft .	2

Rollout photography, a type of peripheral photography, is a process used to create a two dimensional photographic image of a three dimensional object. This process is the photographic equivalent of a cylindrical map projection in cartography. It is used predominantly for the projection of images of cylindrical objects such as vases or ceramic vessels. The objective of this process is to present to the observer a planar representation of the object s characteristics, most notably the illustrations or artwork extant on the outside surfaces of such vessels. This planar representation is captured using photographic imaging techniques.	2

Interesting film about an actual event that took place during the Civil War in Vermont. It kept my attention to the end and I don t regret viewing it.

Meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quaid didn t have as much room in the story as he could have had. I thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded. I d watch it again though. I rated it a 5  wish I could rate it a 5.5 	0

Columbo movies have been going downhill for years, this year it may have reached the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same uninspired performance and comes over as creepy in this movie. As is usual in this series, crime scene protocols are unheard of so plausibility is always lacking. Brenda Vaccaro chews the scenery and pulls pantomime faces and Andrew Stephens is a pretty unconvincing lady s man.  His faint, though, was a hoot  The script was by the numbers and its delivery patronising. They should never have brought Columbo into the nineties, just left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plots, better scripts and sharp characterisations.	0

Basically, Cruel Intentions 2 is Cruel Intentions 1, again, only poorly done. The story is exactly the same as the first one  even some of the lines , with only a few exceptions. The cast is more unknown, and definitely less talented. Instead of being seductive and drawing me into watching it, I ended up feeling dirty because it compares to watching a soft core porn. I m not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic lines on the actors or the writers...and I always feel bad saying that, because I know how hard it is to do both...but it was basically a two hour waste of my life. It literally amazes me that some movies get made, and this is no exception...I can t believe they d make a third one.	0

If you havent seen this film i recommend you do, its far too funny to be taken seriously.	0

Within the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear, fantasizes about murdering his roommate, tries to steal a magazine from a news stand, and lusts after a studly young man he meets at the train station. And he s the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up  except for Krabbe in at least one scene too many  but has nowhere to go. The basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion. Verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations, overt symbolism, and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas.	0

A blind trust is a trust in which the executors or those who have been given power of attorney have full discretion over the assets, and the trust beneficiaries have no knowledge of the holdings of the trust. Blind trusts are generally used when a trustor wishes to keep the beneficiary unaware of the specific assets in the trust, such as to avoid conflict of interest between the beneficiary and the investments. Politicians often place their assets in blind trusts to avoid public scrutiny and accusations of conflicts of interest when they direct government funds to the private sector.	2

After watching about half of this I was ready to give up and turn it off, but I endured to the end. This is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. The acting is poor   much worse than the acting in 80s T A movies. There are several attempts at humour that fail miserably and the movie is 100  predictable. Perhaps if you are a teenager this movie will hold some appeal, but for those that have seen many movies, you will know how the film turns out after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will be spent in agony waiting for the ending credits to roll. Don t waste your time watching this.	0

Not one of the better pokemon movies. Two legendary pokemon come into the story. You do get to see how strong Celebi can be, though he turns evil first. Suicune also makes an appearance, he didn t seem that powerful. The Marauder didn t have many strong pokemon at all, except for that taranitar  Some fight scenes with his pokemon may have made it better. Ash and Pikachu meet the much younger Professor Oak, though they don t realise it. Misty I was thinking had it at the end but she didn t get close. I saw this in the credits.

The only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money. I bought it ex rental for   3.00, it looked interesting, so i took a chance. Within minutes of turning it on i realised i d made a mistake. The entire cast should be stored away until winter and then thrown on the nearest log fire, where they could meet more of their kind. As for the Devin Hamilton  Writer and Director , he should just be shot, sadly this should have been done before he made this rubbish. Avoid this film, If you see it in the shops run away. 1 10	0

In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in the Peruvian Amazon. One year later he walked out of the jungle...naked. It took him 45 years to go back.  Supposedly,  Keep the River On your Right  is  a modern cannibal tale . In reality, anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed. The first half of the movie is more like a travel log of New Ginuea, mostly touting the native art. The second half relies on still photos of a Peruvian cannibal tribe, but really that s about it. Unless of course, you are interested in home movies of a Jewish wedding, or Schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers. I give up. Big disappointment and not really  a modern cannibal tale.

Elizabeth Taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying, untalented self in this film. This was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy. Rock Hudson was OK as Bick Benedict but clearly an actor with more range like William Holden would have been better. James Dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie. The whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long. The actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make up. Hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously the same age. 0 10.	0

The performances of Fishbourne  who appears strangely funny somehow  and  short featured Ed Harris are remarkable, unlike Connery s who doesn t appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a 80yr old man. In fact the screenplay doesn t make sense  imagine a 60 min. happy ending plot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters. It s more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen wrights  schools. The more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets. The capital punishment is not an issue here, although it is a subject from the beginning  it sort of fades away without further comment. The subject matter and environment could have been good.	0

Dennis Hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self  his role was clearly not a stretch for him. And although the movie is supposedly set in Puerto Rico, it feels a lot more like a Hollywood movie lot  all of the main characters are Caucasian and several tend to speak English with pseudo Irish accents.

After reading several good reviews as well as hearing nice things about it by word of mouth I decided to rent Come Undone. I must say I was rather disappointed. The story was hard to follow because the film is set as a series of flashbacks between the present and recent past that are very poorly executed. The characters, despite the actors best efforts are flat and uninteresting. The sex is and nudity are more explicit than they need to be. I ve never seen a film where they seemed so unnecessary to the plot. The ending is very anti climatic and leaves many unanswered questions to a story line that wasn t explained well to begin with. In my opinion, a waste of time.	0

According to Jurga Zilinskiene  head of Today Translations , the difficulty in translating the words picked out by the survey is not finding the meaning of these words, but rather conveying their cultural connotations and overtones.	2

Avoid the USA version. It is with added US footage and the worst dubbing you ve ever heard probably done by New York amateurs. The dubbing is so bad that it sounds like Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Instead of this Americanized version watch Chiba s other greats like The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.	0

About 4 years ago, I liked this movie. I would watch it over and over and over. But now... I don t. Actually, I think this movie would have been great for Mystery Science Theater 3000. It has a bunch of comment heavy actors  Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg , and a pretty cheesy plot. My favorite part is when Culkin is riding his bike and he comes across a gang and a gang member says,  Hey, Tyler  Where ya goin   The MOON    Also look out for the classic line,  Do you have feeling in your toes   On the other hand, it s better than  The Good Son .	0
Saw in on TV late last night. Yeah, I can hear what y all say about this one. It IS likely to be categorized as one of those stereo  typical TV soap series. In all fairness, the story line does have a fine twist to it, and you might nod saying,  Well, that s not what I expected.  But, as a film, well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element. Casting, acting, camera work, cars, costume, setting, script, no, there s nothing to congratulate. Rated R   Oh, that scene.

What didn t I like  CGI for one. Amazingly bad. More importantly is the faithfulness to the storyline, not to mention the stilted acting. I am used to both with all the versions I have seen.

Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as great as usual. Ritter wasn t bad either. What s her name was as pretty as usual. It could have been a good movie. To bad the plot was atrocious. It was completely predictable, trite and boring. From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the movie was laid out like a child s paint by numbers routine. The characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard. There was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting, which was a pity. Finally, too bad the script writer wasn t the victim. Especially with the  precocious  lines from the child, which were completely unbelievable. Again, it s only the acting that prevented a much lower score.	0

Dangoule Rasalaite was a 16 year old girl who came to Sweden from Lithuania with her boyfriend during the autumn of 1999 looking for work. Instead she was locked up in an apartment in Arlv  outside Malm , and forced into prostitution. She took her life in January 2000 by jumping from a road bridge in Malm. Her story inspired the director Lukas Moodysson film Lilja 4 ever about the trafficking in human beings. However, it should be recognized that in an interview with the British newspaper, The Guardian, Lukas Moodysson admitted that he hardly did any research at all before making the film. Lilja 4 ever must thus be seen as a highly fictionalised version of a true story.	2

The movie is basically a boring string of appalling clich  s which do not offer a real cross cultural insight. The Middle Eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way  there obviously are mud brick villages, dirt tracks in the middle of the desert, women clad in black robes and belly dancers. I wonder how camels and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture. The personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible. The original idea might have been interesting, but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight, you should skip this movie.	0

Alan Alda plays real life  Sports Illustrated  writer George Plimpton, who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. Rather wan, uncompelling drama curiously tempered with fantasy. Director Alex March takes an interesting tack on this material, shooting it in a quasi documentary fashion  with macho commentary  and yet giving the tale a touch of Capraesque whimsy  still, by bringing out the cinematic flashiness in this set up, he turns the main narrative into a jumble. Alda s smug, uncharismatic performance is another handicap, though the supporting cast is filled with real life pro athletes  and scintillating Lauren Hutton as Alda s girlfriend  how s that for a fantasy  .  1 2 from     	0

The dancing was probably the ONLY watchable thing about this film  and even that was disappointing compared to some other films.

Yes, it s beautifully photographed, but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself. Tango is a tease, it s hot, it has drama, it s audacious  precisely what this film is not.	0

God may be a judge, but I don t think He is going to measure every level of goodness. Give the Creator some credit.	0

Admittedly, Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone, although it is a favourite of mine, Knappertsbusch, 1951, in particular. Syberberg s entire approach is so static. Whenever the music suddenly begins to swell...Syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same pace. The takes on Amfortas and Klingsor are endless. Whatever happened to film editing  The result is physically exhausting to watch. The viewer is never spiritually transported. Your impulse is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that Wagner got it right, Syberberg got it wrong.

Recognition of the many possible symptoms of this infection belonging to a single disease was not until the 1820s and it was J.L.

AntiTrust could have been a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director cut out her best scenes. In the scenes that she are in, she is just a zombie. She is involved in a sub plot that is simular to a sub plot in  Get Carter , but she handles the sub plot better in  Get Carter . I blame the director  The director s homage to Hitchcock was corny.  It s the scene were Ryan Philippe s charactor realizes he may not be able to trust Tim Robbin s charactor, at least I think it s a homage to Hitchcock. The DVD shows the scenes that were cut out. I think the director should have trust his instincts and not listen to the test audiences.	0

The movie opens upon Julian Sands, lying on his back, a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it, about two feet above him. That was so provocative, and I thought,  Here we go  A good vampire movie   And then it died. That was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination. It was slow, uneventful drivel thereafter. I was vastly disappointed, as my previous experience with Sands  acting was quite enjoyable. However, this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired. Even Julian Sands s questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie. It rates a 1.1 10 from... the Fiend  .	0

Necessarily ridiculous film version the literary classic  Moby Dick . John Barrymore is Captain Ahab, who falls in love with the pastor s daughter, Joan Bennett. His brother Derek is a rival for Ms. Bennett s affections. When Mr. Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident, Bennett rejects him. He must slay the whale and win Bennett back... There are several scenes which may have thrilled 1930 theater audiences  particularly the scenes involving Barrymore losing his leg. The film hasn t aged well, however  there are much better films from the time, both 1920s silents and 1930s talkies. The two name attractions, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett aren t at their best.      Moby Dick  8 14 30  Lloyd Bacon   John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes	0

A very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting, but where the hell is the ending to this film  In fact, what is the point of it  The scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally, and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storyline. The performances of the cast are questionable, if not believable. Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the film  I guess we have to wait for the sequel.	0

Living in the Middle East  in Israel , I was excited when I bought my ticket for Syriana. Having seen the trailer, and being a thriller lover, I expected to see first of all a fast moving, breath catching movie, which wisely dips in global policy making and the relation between oil, power and corruption, from a fresh angle. Well, I almost left the movie in the middle. The pace was painfully slow, almost all characters were stereotyped, the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, in the end you don t care.

I really don t understand all these positive user reviews. This movie is the worst movie I ve ever seen and I m not trying to be pessimistic. Eva Mendez is hot but terrible in this film. But I don t think it is her own fault but the directors. He have somehow managed to make everything look artificial  their acting, the idea, the make up, everything. The star I m giving is only for the idea behind the movie, which was very bad executed. Don t watch this bullshit, go watch a Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.	0
While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start. Although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there, the pace of The Gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat inadequate, and the plot confusing. Worse, the characterization in the premiere episode is poor. Although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, I remember The Gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series.	0

Loaded with fine actors, I expected much more from  Deceiver  than was delivered. The plot is extremely contrived and manipulative. The many flashbacks only add to the confusion. Believability flies out the window and with the ending becomes unbearable and downright ridiculous. I would strongly advise anyone who likes their movie plots to be based on something that is at least possible to avoid  Deceiver  because you will be very frustrated. Maybe I am just not hip enough to get it, but my suspicion is that many others were totally confused by the story line and especially by the ending. Blurring the line between reality and lies simply does not work because the entire movie made no sense.   MERK	0

I actually went to see this film in a theater, but what a complete waste of time and money  Bad acting, I m sorry to say, did not help to enjoy this rather sticky screenplay. Some friends told me to go and see this film, since James Redfield, the author of the book, was very heavily involved in the screenplay. They had really enjoyed the book, so the movie just had to be perfect. Well maybe I had my hopes up a bit too high, but I absolutely hated this movie  It was predictable, too sweetish to a point that I actually left I had to vomit and worst of all there is going to be a sequel  Do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade.	0

White flight is a term for the demographic trend where upper and middle class white Americans move away from non white inner city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs and exurbs. Major causes of white flight in United States cities inculde racism, redlining, blockbusting, restrictive covenants, and mortgage discrimination. These practices denied or increased the cost of services, such as banking and insurance, to residents in racially and economically determined inner city neighborhoods while, at the same, time barring blacks from taking advantage of low mortgage rates and new housing in suburban developments.	2

Unlike the Lighthorse who were under the direction of the individual tribe, the USIP was under the direction of the Indian Agent assigned to the Union Agency. Many of the US Indian police officers were given Deputy US Marshal commissions that allowed them to cross juridictional boundaries and also to arrest non Indians.	2

Lies  tells about an affair between an 18 year old bucktoothed female student and a scrawny 38 year old married man with the pair of protags spending about half the screen time engaged in naked sex and hokey whipping and the other half meandering through the pathetically naive storyline which seems little more than an excuse for the sex scenes. With very poor production value including obvious sanitary appliances and phony softcore sex to a story which is a messy mix of comedy and drama,  Lies  quickly becomes redundant ad nauseam. With an almost 2 hour run, subtitles, and so little substance,  Lies  is simply not recommendable.  C  	0
I began watching this movie with low expectations, as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a S.K. novel  a novel i never read . I m glad my expectations were low because the movie wasn t nothing close to good, but it manages to keep you interested. What really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors. The movie is overlong, hasn t no  nice  shots and no scares, the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are crap.

The boss at West Ham was Syd King, an outsize, larger than life character with close cropped grey hair and a flowing moustache. He was a personality plus man, a man with flair. Awe struck, I would tip toe past his office but invariably he would spot me.  Boy,  he would shout.  Get me two bottles of Bass.  Down to the Boleyn pub on the corner I would go on my errand and when I got back to the office Syd King would flip me a two shilling piece for my trouble.

I have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film. I even got the rental company to give me my money back because I argued that they perpetrated false advertising. It s not enough that the movie itself is a p.o.s., but the cover art is what sold me. I ve done better make up effects on my children at Halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art. Can you say  raccoon eyes   I m not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details, but come on, the movie s main character is an L.A. cop who was born and raised in Alabama   but has a German accent    It s beyond insulting.	0

The Mohs hardness is 2 and the specific gravity ranges from 2.74 to 2.95. Refractive indices are n  1.588 n  1.617 n  1.655. It is an oxidation product of primary copper mineralization in a weathering environment with abundant aluminium and sulfate.

Director F.W. Murnau wisely stuck with the silent film medium he knew so well to cover this story of native islander life in the South Seas. The documentary style works very well for the first half of the movie. The landscapes are beautiful, and the daily life activities of the islanders are interesting to watch. The film loses momentum, though, when it begins to concentrate more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers. The storyline just never gets that interesting, despite being handled well by Murnau. Won an Academy Award for best cinematography, although the award probably should have been for best scenery. You can t really credit the DP for getting to shoot in such a beautiful location.	0

Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater, Chuck Traynor. I don t understand how having sex with a dog  which is animal abuse, as well  can be found to be entertaining or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films. I know some people will criticize this comment but I feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. We call ourselves  civilized  however I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized.	0

One of Scorsese s worst. An average thriller  the only thing to recommend it is De Niro playing the psycho. The finale is typically of this genre i.e. over the top, with yet another almost invincible, immune to pain villain. I didn t like the 60s original, and this version wasn t much of an improvement on it. I have no idea why Scorsese wasted his time on a remake. Then again, considering how bad his recent movies have been  I m referring to his dull Buddhist movie and all the ones with his new favourite actress, the blond girl Di Caprio  this isn t even that bad by comparison. And considering Spielberg wanted to do the remake... could have been far worse.	0

This is one seriously disturbed movie. Even Though the boys deserved some of what they got.....the sadistic gruesome executions were  slightly  over the top. The only character showing some conscience early in the hunt was killed off before he could offer some help to the sad plot. At the beginning of the movie, there looked to be some promise of a mediocre affair, but this was just a ploy to lull the viewers into a false sense of security, before the joy of what was to come. The only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if Jack Nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and yelled,  and, where is the batman  . Kim Basinger could have screamed. Now that would have been cool 	0

About twenty minutes into this movie, I was already bored. Quite simply, these characters were fairly dull. Occasionally, something enjoyable would happen, but then things would slow down again. Fortunately, my patience was eventually rewarded, and the ending to this movie wasn t bad at all. However, it was by no means good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minutes. So, I would say that the movie was mediocre overall, and considering all of the talent in the cast, I d call this a disappointment.	0

Director Fred Schepisi Roxanne  directs this well intentioned, but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein Matthau  trying to hook his scientific niece Ryan  up with ordinary guy Tim Robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950 s. To get Ryan to like Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is cute, but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat, but are unable to rescue the film. Its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie. I would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of Meg Ryan.	0

In compiler theory, an intrinsic function is a function available in a given language whose implementation is handled specially by the compiler. Typically, it substitutes a sequence of automatically generated instructions for the original function call, similar to an inline function. Unlike an inline function though, the compiler has an intimate knowledge of the intrinsic function and can therefore better integrate it and optimize it for the situation. This is also called builtin function in numerical programming languages like Matlab, Octave etc.	2

Seriously, Dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny  I would highly recommend almost ANY other movie on the AFI s top 100 comedies for more laughs than this. If you want to see a funnier  drunk , try The Thin Man. Funnier movie in general, any Marx Brothers movie will kill  especially if you re as drunk as Arthur .	0

This was so horrible, I spent half the movie watching in fast forward to get to the nudity, which was minimal. I think MAYBE three scenes of partial nudity. Cheesy dialogue, crappy violence, poor excuses of characters.

This is a film that was made almost entirely in the directors head. Sure, it would have been nice if he d transfered it to film, but this happened instead.

Binary Synchronous Communication  BSC or Bisync  is an IBM link protocol, announced in 1967 after the introduction of System 360. It replaced the synchronous transmit receive  STR  protocol used with second generation computers. The intent was that common link management rules could be used with three different alphabets for encoding messages. Six bit Transcode looked backwards to older systems  USASCII with 128 characters and EBCDIC with 256 characters looked forward. Transcode disappeared very quickly but the EBCDIC dialect of Bisync still has very limited use in the 2000s.	2

Harold Wright Cruse  March 8, 1916 March 30, 2005  was an outspoken social critic and teacher of African American studies at the University of Michigan until the mid 1980s. His most recognized work is The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual, which was published in the mid 1960s. One of the resounding themes in Crisis was, as Christopher Lasch put it, that intellectuals must play a central role in movements for radical change.  This theme re appeared in his other works which include Rebellion or Revolution  a compilation of essays  and Plural But Equal  where Crisis of the Negro Intellectual dealt with the cultural axis of the politics economics culture triangle, Plural But Equal dealt more with politics and economics .	2

The reason the DVD releases of this film are in black and white is because nobody can get their hands on a color print of this public domain film, a modest sea story at best. Distributed for television thru Allied Artists, DVD s  or VHS  on the market at this time for this title are all coming from the same 16MM television print. Films distributed for television prior to 1963 were often distributed in b w prints, because the bulk of viewers did not have color sets anyway. Striking b w prints for television was also cheaper, as it often involved quite a few prints to cover all stations running a film on a syndicated basis.	0

Ultimately too silly and pointless. Yes there is the gilded cage metaphor but probably most kids would miss that. Forgettable. Instantly. Animation is, as we have come to expect, super real. The plot line could best be described as thin but tenacious. Although the ending seemed arbitrary to me. The sewer underworld is a suitably disgusting reflection of the world above and, somehow, wealth and money seem to count for a lot there too. Oh yes, and there s a romantic interest with the female being the smarter, more savvy and go getting of the pair   this in itself is rapidly becoming a tiresome  anti  stereotype. Probably your kids will love it though.	0

Telemental Health is the use of telecommunications technology to provide mental health services to individuals in communities or locations that are underserviced. Under service is typically a result of geographic isolation. Examples of telemental health services include providing health workers in remote areas with continuing education on mental health topics, videoconferened consultations on routine and urgent mental health cases using a  virtual  case management team, and providing direct mental health care services through two way interactive systems. One of the most controversial telemental health care applications is providing treatment services over the Internet directly which, while showing early promise, will likely require considerable development to be made practical.	2

Needless remake, and it can t come close to capturing the charm of the original. The extreme length causes more than a few yawn inducing parts. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film lacks style, and mostly it lacks talent, not just with the acting, but the direction, sets, costumes etc. are all below par. It has a blatant disregard for period detail. Vanessa Williams is the only cast member that shows any flair, Tyne Daly isn t too bad. They should have left well enough alone. The singing ranges good  Vanessa Williams  to poor  everyone else . Watch the original 1963 version and skip this one. There is not much here to recommend.	0

That was one in many goof ups of the movie    Anything good in the movie  yes, for kareena fans, if there are any, Kareena in bikini. For akshay fans, his dialogs and action stunts.

Did anyone read the script. This has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson couldn t pull this one out. About two thirds it looked like Giamatti eyes were saying, I can t believe I signed the contract. It s not the worst movie I ever saw, but it s on the really really bad Christmas movie list. Not enough lines, but what else can be said  Okay, the movie just doesn t move with Vaughn s con man dialogue, his character is just a creepy guy that you just can t get past.

I m at this very moment debating whether I should even finish watching this  poppycock  of a movie. They had a pretty interesting idea, with the buried movie set, and that was it. So far this incomprehensible mess has no real story. There is the buried set, some wolf headed monster running amok, an amulet, and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is. What I would have missed, had I had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a dune buggy chase, some really bad C.G.I., some incredibly stupid dialog, more bad C.G.I., and the hero fighting paper cut outs. Other than the original idea, this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities. My mistake for continuing to watch.   MERK	0

I saw this film at a pre release screening at the Writers Guild theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, the film s producers and director were in attendance, presumably to gage our reaction. Many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience, which would have been fine if it had been a comedy, but it was supposed to be a horror film. If the audience wasn t scared, it seems the filmmakers were. They delayed release for over a year. Out of curiosity I saw it again to see if they d re cut it  as far as I can tell, they hadn t. It was the same lousy movie, just a year older. It almost qualifies as  so bad, it s good,  but it s slow paced and boring.	0

I thought this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles, and gave their characters some personality  but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical. The beginning could have been a lot more involving  perhaps starting with a shootout, and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing. And I felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted, like a very bad tv soap. I was really looking forward to this movie, and hoping for something a lot better. The only thing I can say in its favour is that it beats the Mick Jagger version, but not by much.	0
Being an Elvis fan, I can t understand how this proyect could be done. Is by far the worst Elvis related movie of all time, totally unfunny, silly and plenty of mistakes about The King. Come on, Elvis  grave in a public park  A mention about Suspicious Minds in 1958 ...and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast tries to do their best, Mike Starr is funny  specially as an impersonator , the Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise, but the guy playing the young Elvis sucks.Overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute. If you want to see an ultra cheap, insane but absolutely funny little film related to Elvis, I truly recommend you  Bubba Ho Tep  instead of this mess.	0

This film is absolutely horrific. One of the worst movies I ve ever seen. The story does nearly not exist, the characters are full of stereotypes and the Special FX only make you laugh.

If you want to watch this movie  please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughs...especially when the first Special FX appear on the screen.

The two doesn t seem to gel and in the end you get nowhere. This could be so much better done and the story seemed to drag towards the end. This was most boring and disappointing.	0

The Constitution was promulgated by Pope Paul VI on November 18, 1965, following approval by the assembled bishops by a vote of 2,344 to 6. The phrase  Dei Verbum  is Latin for  Word of God  and appears in the first line of the document, as is customary for major Catholic documents.	2

The power rangers is definitely the worst television show and completely ridiculous plastic toy line in the history of the United States. There is absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining about this completely awful television show. This is simply the worst show ever made, with awful actors, dressing up in multi colored spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous. The owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves, since there is no redeeming value to this nonsense.

How sad there is no option to post a mark lower than 1. I watched this piece of nonsense and could barely believe what i was watching. Every single part of the film was awful. Music, acting, direction, story, everything, simply everything. I actually found myself laughing out loud at various points in the film. I particularly loved the bit where our hero is dashing through the hospital in soft focus slow motion, and knocks the clipboard out of the nurses hand, because, .............well. Just because. Product placement  Crucifix s  crucifi   everywhere. If you are of a Christian persuasion and very easily satisfied, you may like this movie. If you do like this movie, you really need to get out more.	0

Plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption, murder, power and the rest of thriller related topics. Characters are interesting though sometimes. Not realistic but interesting nevertheless. Development is slow like tea drinking ceremony. Visuals not stunning, but good enough to ease the eye strain. Good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed   nothing shocking too much, nothing overexciting. Movie sitcom style. I liked Woody   excellent performance. Had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good. The rest are bearable though very predictable. The whole is watchable and better than most TV shows.	0

There is no much point is commenting an adult film. But this one contains a minimal plot, and the characters are believable. It was shown in the United States in normal cinemas. I ve seen it In Pensylvannia way back in 1975. As such it deserves a place in an Encyclopedia of Movies.

This solid little horror film is actually one of Renny Harlin s best. The story is pretty routine stuff, but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive  in fact, the ghost story is almost an afterthought.

This movie is mostly chase scenes and special effects. It is very weak on plot. Most of the computer talk was just mumbo jumbo. I watched this because I was a big fan of the original War Games movie which was based mostly on computer fact and real computer terminology. This movie had none of that. Most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic of real computers and networks, but just lame. It is like it was written by somebody who has no comprehension of real computers. The ripley game was lame and was essentially just an arcade game. No real hacking, so what was the point  Movie was boring. Lame sequel.	0

The lamps were usually equipped with some form of optical sight, and were most commonly used on naval vessels and in airport control towers  using color signals for stop or clearance .	2

Anyone who is a sucker for 1920s jazz, 1920s dress, the Charleston, and ultra swanky yachts  e.g. me, on all counts  will want to like this movie. But the sad fact is that that s all there is. The plot is banal and obvious, the acting mostly either awful or playing to the farcical side of the goings on, and when the whole thing s over there is not much left but the impression of mirrors and smoke. This is a beautifully made bad movie.	0

This film failed to explore the humanity of the animals which left me with an empty feeling inside.  Spoiler ahead  I was not convinced that Dr. D really had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends. Whereas Babe  the original  bucked the trend of big budget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs. their humans counterparts, all the animals in this film were nothing more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meat grinder  even more so if one could understand their pointless babble . Without Eddie Murphy s zany behavior, this film would be a flop.	0

Many branches of mathematics study objects of a certain type and prove a theorem that classifies these objects. A common theme is that the classification results in a number of series of objects as well as a finite number of exceptions that don t fit into any series. These are known as  exceptional objects . Frequently these objects play an important role in the subject and surprisingly, the exceptional objects in one branch of mathematics are often related to the exceptional objects in others.	2

Consilience, or the unity of knowledge  literally a  jumping together  of knowledge , has its roots in the ancient Greek concept of an intrinsic orderliness that governs our cosmos, inherently comprehensible by logical process, a vision at odds with mystical views in many cultures that surrounded the Hellenes. The rational view was recovered during the high Middle Ages, separated from theology during the Renaissance and found its apogee in the Age of Enlightenment. Then, with the rise of the modern sciences, the sense of unity gradually was lost in the increasing fragmentation and specialization of knowledge in the last two centuries. The converse of consilience in this way is Reductionism.	2

Almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense. The director of the  almost equally embarrassing  movie  Ratcatcher  returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense  it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation.

Rather, the land is held in trust for the band by the Crown.	2

He is then finally promoted to sergeant, but is unable to decide between a sniper and surgeon career, so he quits from the Army altogether. One year later, frustrated with civilian life, he joins the Navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform.	0

A boring movie about a boring town in the 50 s. How can anyone think this is a classic  The producer pretty much ended his career by pushing his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, into several movies that were way above her acting ability. I think this movie gives an insight to how bad Peter Bogdonovitch s future movies were going to be. Cybil Shepard s career took a dive after being in several movies that Peter Bogdonovich produced.

The film is poorly casted, except for some familiar old Hollywood names. Other performances by unknown names  i.e., Jennifer Gabrielle  are uninspiring. I have seen other films by this director, unfortunately this is one of his worst. Perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay  In a positive note, Kim Bassinger s and Pat Morita s performance saved the movie from oblivion. I enjoyed Pat more in Karate Kid, though. There are many good movies to see, and in short, this one is not one of them. Save your money and the celluloid. Jason Vanness	0

Unbelievably awful film. I watched part of this on T.V. recently. My jaw dropped as I watched a horrendously conceived plot and listened to mind numbing drivel. Not a single line from the master of one liners could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle. It was so bad it made me want to exhume Rodney Dangerfield s body, slap him around and scream,  How could you   I know many films are done in haste, hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme. But please, Hollywood, show a little respect for your audience. It s sad and scary that people were expected to pay to see such tripe. The bottom of the cesspool, even by Sunday afternoon television standards.	0

I watched Written on The Wind starring Rock Hudson,Lauren Becall,Robert Stack   Dorothy Malone  Robert Stack was terrible  just bloody horrible  he was supposed to be a charming jet setting millionaire  instead he came off like a jerk from the word go  the plot was stupid and overwrought and the 3  romantic  leads had no chemistry. Somehow Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for best supporting actress  although her campy tramp character was boring  think the older sister from Splendour in The Grass filled with malice and bitterness and lacking charisma. Director Douglas Sirk has the entire cast overact their way through dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes.

When I saw previews of this movie I thought that it may be dumb, but it will at least be funny. Well I was wrong. Even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re evaluating their life, the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible. The first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny. But by the end, I could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next. Throughout the movie I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre, which is still more than I can say for the movie itself.	0

Raymond Saunders is a Canadian clockmaker who has designed and built more than 150 customized clocks that mainly serve as tourist attracting public artworks. In 1977 he was commissioned to build a steam clock for the Gastown district of Vancouver, Canada. The Gastown clock may be the first steam clock ever built, although there is evidence that 19th century British engineer John Inshaw made a steam clock after which was named a Birmingham pub. Saunders has since built six different public steam clocks for clients such as the city of Otaru, Japan, and the Indiana State Museum.	2

Unbeknownst to the man, he has been attacked by a werewolf and now he s inherited the curse associated with such creatures.

Horrifically re produced from the original Spanish,  The Fury of the Wolf Man  loses whatever charms it may have possessed in its original form. Lycanthropic Paul Naschy s werewolf characterization is uneven and ineffectual. Dominatrix scientist Perla Cristal and sexy assistant Ver  nica Luj  n never get close enough to truly titillate.

When you re making a thriller about witchcraft, I believe you should do everything you can to help the audience suspend its disbelief in order for the movie to work. Some pictures   Rosemary s Baby , for example  have accomplished this  others  like  Necromancy   haven t and the potentially scary material comes across as corny and goofy. This film does have some atmospheric moments, but about half the dialogue is hard to make out  sometimes it s poorly recorded, at other times just incomprehensible  and Orson Welles, who gets top billing, has a role that is so BENEATH him that you have to assume he was desperate for the work. Or maybe he was simply having fun.....  1 2 	0

This comedy has some tolerably funny stuff in it, surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff. Just about every scene involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics is a waste of time. And the plotting is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this, or they were simply making it all up as they went along.   1 2 	0

Absolutely horrific film. Ameteurish and it isn t funny at all. Lead character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying. Edits by E.T and star wars is just plain stupid. Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good think about this movie. He should master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood cannot find an actor with his qualities. Other than Goksal this movie is a garbage. Director Gani Mujde is a comic writer and this movie is his worst written work to this date. Music of Cem Karaca is another plus of this waste of money. Actor Sumer Tilmac also have some presence. Actor who plays the three sons has no talent what so ever.	0

I think the biggest disappointment in this film was that, right until the end, I expected the acting instructors of the cast to break in and apologize for how poor the acting was.

After I watched this movie, I came to IMDb and read some of the reviews, which compared it to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read that I immediately could see the reviewers point. This movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme. Interestingly, the format of the movie is nearly identical, but the PACING is incredibly different.  10 Items  rushes the viewer through the 1 day time line of the movie, whereas the better planned  Lost In...  seems to stretch out over a few long days. I m sure some people will see this because it has Morgan Freeman, and will be disappointed. It seems his better roles now a days are supporting roles in big blockbusters, rather than leading roles in sub  10mil limited release movies and indie films.	0

I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but this was too much. The acting wasn t great, but that wasn t the real problem. The issue was the sinking feeling I got in the pit of my stomach about 20 minutes into the film. These characters were hollow. They had almost no depth, and what little they did have was devoted to the cruelty they displayed to each other in the guise of friendship. Exploring the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating, but you have to give those characters actual personalities or they are just cardboard cutouts. These characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly.	0
Simply terrible  Why wouldn t you use actual actors  Look, this has to stop  Stop using non actors  If you want any credibility or any message sent via these low budget films...please for the love of god use real actors  Most will work for free...take advantage of that  Now back to my comment...anyway, the humour was lower than that of the bathroom variety and wasn t funny on any level. As for the quality...in one scene filmed on a public transportation bus you could see the reflection of the crew...guess what  It was one guy with what looked like a Sony Camcorder and probably not even his. Well, I assume the only audience for this film are people with a gore fetish...and it wasn t even good gore.	0

Have I ever seen a film more shockingly inept  I can think of plenty that equal this one, but none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue. I am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot, but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz don t provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this. Avoid, it s obviously a style of film that Americans haven t really got a grasp of. Watch the final result if you must, and you ll see what I m talking about, but DON T say I didn t warn you...	0

M Base  short for  macro basic array of structured extemporization   is a concept of how to create modern music which reached its peak in the mid to late 80s and early 90s. It was also a word used to reference a collective of musicians, poets and dancers in this same time period who were associated with the movement. M Base is often seen as a kind of jazz, but, strictly speaking, this is not entirely accurate, and the participants do not view M Base in this manner.	2

Chances are if I watched this again I might get physically sick, the film is so annoying.....unless you believe in psychics, re incarnation and the other hocus  pocus which this promotes big time.

Too bad they had to waste the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. At least it s a pretty tame film, language wise.

The Radar Men from the Moon is a pretty typical fare of 1950 s serials.

It does inspire the imagination of children, to whom I believe this was directed to. By today s standards, it s boring, cheap, and bad. There s also a hefty amount of stock footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.	0

All internet buzz aside, this movie was god awful. I expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything. Instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller horror movie, and they completely missed. There were only a few good parts, and a couple good lines by Samuel Jackson. Other than that, it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes. All of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie. Now that the movie has actually come out, hopefully this joke will die. Don t waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash.

The turgid pace of this movie numbs us to any shocks that it might provide. There was no real suspense. Most of the characters were insipid. The chesty Irish priest was as lame as the love interest. Interest is misleading. The girl that they chose to provide the film s sensuality might be better. The central conflict of the main character was uninvolving. This film is entirely devoid of positives. It is like a tedious exercise by someone who didn t want to go to the gym that day but did anyway.	0
Iberia is nice to see on TV. But why see this in silver screen  Lot of dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie. But otherwise one and half hour is just too long time. If you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it s better to see Bollywood movie. They know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie. Director Carlos Saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience. And time to time it s look really good. but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting. There are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big.	0

I have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the Wrinkle in Time Chronicles. My dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading A Winkle in Time, and would think, what an amazing movie this would make. Sadly enough that screenwriter failed, changing characters, throwing in lame humor, and all out destroying the plot. I know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie. But why can t you stay true to the book  Why must you change the way characters think and act  For those of you who have not read the book, pick it up, find a soft couch, and let your imagination run wild.	0

I must be that one guy in America that didn t like this movie. I guess this just wasn t my style or something, I just don t see what s so fascinating about it, this was  barely entertaining, let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. It s about a guy that came from nothing, and goes on to become a drug lord. Pretty simple way to describe an entire movie, and that s exactly my feeling about the entire movie. Contrary to what a lot of people think, just because a movie is about mafias drug trade criminal groups doesn t automatically make it a great movie, don t forget good storytelling.	0

The Long Watch  is a science fiction short story by Robert A. Heinlein. It appears in Heinlein s short story collections, The Green Hills of Earth and The Past Through Tomorrow.

Actually, though  Space Cadet  is chronologically set some eighty years after  The Long Watch , it was published a year earlier, and the story seems to have grown out of a short remark in the book. 	2

This is a very sad movie. Really. Nothing happens in this movie. The Script is bad    I guess they ve just copy paste the first 15 pages to 90 pages. The Producers must have thought let s create a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They didn t succeed. Now in the third week it is only running in Antwerp and Brussels at 22h45 or something. In the past we have had really good movies in Belgium, like Daens. Shades is a waste of your time. Maybe you could sneak in the theater after you ve seen a real movie. If you ve seen 10 minutes of Shades, you ve seen it all. It was advertised to death on local radio and TV. I hope it will disappear in the Shades soon.	0

Weaker entry in the Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard in the role. Usual funny banter and antics, but not much plot. Barrymore gets something to do as the inspector, swapping disguises to follow Drummond, Algy, and Tenny on a wild goose chase  mostly in circles  perhaps the budget was tighter than usual  to rescue poor Phyllis, who is being held captive by people who want to lure Drummond to his doom. For those keeping score, in this one, Drummond is planning to ask Phyllis to marry him and Algy is worried about missing the baby s christening. It s fun to see Algy and Tenny dressed up as fisherman to blend in at The Angler s Rest, but little of it rises above silly.	0

This sports a nice, deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk. The first third of this movie was nothing but talk, and more talk. Most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other. The first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it s really a  chick flick  and little else. This probably plays on the Lifetime network. There was a quick murder scene and then more talk. By halfway through, they had lost me. By the way, Sally Field looked about 15 years old in here.	0

What is it with Americans and their hang up with religious gobbledy gook  To think this was a best selling novel is incredible, but to pull it off as a movie you really need good acting and a script that delivers. In this case, all the good actors have gone to heaven and we re left with Kirk Cameron as a CNN type journalist    trying to discover why a lot of people have simply disappeared. Oh yeah, there s a subplot about an evil world conspiracy and famine, or something. The good news is that this is done so cheaply, and with such inane dialogue, that it has sheer entertainment value in all of its unintended laughs. Not recommended for anyone with a 3 digit IQ.	0

If you are under the age of 6 or 7, then you re going to really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she watches it. As an adult, I can t stand it   I m all up for sequels....when they have a decent storyline. But this is nowhere near up to standard. Please forgive me for slating what is after all a kid s film, but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much, you ll understand why. My daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her. I ve given this film 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained.	0

This dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are misused badly here. I might have chuckled once or twice during this film, but in general, it s a boring movie, with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure. The premise, although routine, still wasn t bad, but once the plot was set, the film went nowhere. Don t waste your time with this misfire.	0

This centers on unironic notions of coming to grips with guilt. Merrill berates the distraught boy to stop his  whining  about Rennie s death. Old style real men in action, here. The crashing model plane and car crash must have been impressive on the big screen. The storytelling itself, despite the flashback sequences, plays it straight  all the narrators are trusted by us  regardless of the  truth  or  untruth  of the dialogue , so there s no game with the viewer about narrative structure. This would become a rough template for future retellings, such as  Fearless . So all we re left with is individual performance, and at that level, it s best for Wynn s bantering, a virtual one man show.	0

Strained comedy, a sketch like revue which was initially a vehicle to showcase one time radio star Jack Pearl but is now best remembered as America s introduction to The Three Stooges. Actually, Larry, Curly and Moe are billed alongside comic Ted Healy as Ted Healy and his Three Stooges.

Incredibly loud and overbearing, it shows how far Hollywood had to go to reach a certain level of slapstick sophistication.  1 2 from     	0

I don t have much to say about this movie. It could have been a wonderful tour de force for Peter Sellers, but it is one of the most tragic misfires in movie history. That it was Sellers final movie makes it all the more painful. The terrible screenplay, direction and shockingly wooden performances all come dreadfully together to make this one of the most unwatchably awful movies ever made. I wish so much that I could find even a snicker or a chuckle buried somewhere in this pile of putrid blubber, but it s a lifeless, humorless disaster. The truth hurts. Peter, why couldn t you have stopped at BEING THERE 	0
This is not a good movie. Too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par. The 3D was OK, but not superb. I almost fell asleep in this movie. The story is about 3 young flies that want to have adventure and follow up on it. The characters are lacking, I truly do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested. Pixar this is not. I would have liked to see more special 3D effects. Also I wold like to see more fly jokes than the mom constantly saying  Lord of the flies  Pretty sexist in showing the women as house wives and fainting.	0
This movie is a farce  Names are grossly mispronounced and the plot is twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable by any literature enthusiast. And they have the gall to give Beowulf a ridiculous cannon crossbow weapon. Beowulf doesn t need a weapon like that  In the poem, he rips off Grendel s arm with his bare hands  And I can t believe that the scriptwriters did such a thing. The way Grendel is portrayed is impressive however. That and the cast are the only positive points of the feature. My English teacher would go insane if she saw this abomination. Unless you are a die hard fan of the epic poem  Beowulf,  avoid this film at all costs. And even then, I wouldn t recommend it.	0

There s nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland, and Robot Wars does deliver. Sure, the acting is lousy, the dialogue is sub par, and the characters are one dimensional, but it has giant robots  The special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period. They are certainly not as polished as today s standards, but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures, so it has aged fairly well. Its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime, and it does have a certain tongue in cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable. I would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction.	0

European Vacation  aka National Lampoon s European Vacation  is the weakest of the Vacation films  the first and third one the most superior of the films . While Chevy Chase and Beverly D Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold  with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold , this time they are given a weaker script with very bad dialogue. This causes the pacing to suffer, with the jokes not very funny at all. To be more specific, what really causes this film to suffer is the fact that the  jokes  as they are, are just pasted together into a cobbled together script , rather than serving a central plot as the other 3 Vacation films have. Oh well, they can t win them all. 4 out of 10.	0

In metallurgy normalization is allowing a metal to cool to room temperature after heating without quenching or annealing. This process is confined to steel. It is used to refine grains which, have become coarse through work hardening, to improve ductility and toughness of the steel. It involves heating the steel to just above its upper critical point. It is soaked for a short period then allowed to cool in air. Small grains are formed which give a much harder and tougher metal with normal tensile strength and not the maximum softness achieved by annealing.	2

Personally I think this show looks pretty cheaply made. Some of the actors are terrible. They over do it   seem fake. I can always tell how it s going to end within the first 10 minutes or less of watching because they make it so transparently clear. It s not very well written either. I love to watch it to laugh at it. You know the saying  It s so bad that it s good   Well, that saying applies to this show. I also like to watch just to see if I m right when I guess how it s all going to end. So far I ve been right every time. It s like a little game that I play. It s nice when you are bored   you feel like laughing at something.	0

Before seeing this movie, I would ve said that I loved everything Kathy Bates has done. Now it s everything minus one. James Woods is pathetic...not his character, his acting. Someone should ve told him that  poor  is not synonymous with dirty, nor ignorant, nor cliche. Ditto for Randy Quaid s stereotyping. The only redeeming feature is Henry Thomas, who isn t a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess. If you enjoy the country, you ll enjoy the scenery. That s the best I can give it. I m a serious fan of both independent and quirky films, but this is simply terrible.	0
This is, quite literally, the worst movie I have ever watched in my life. It may be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad that they re good  this movie is so bad that it goes past enjoyable camp and simply becomes unwatchably awful. It is the anti enantiodromia. We bought it with the intent to heckle, and all of my family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks  instead, we sat in stunned silence, pitying poor Peter Sellers. This is worse than the animated Lord of the Rings. It is worse than the Matrix sequels. It is worse than Krull. It is worse than any Batman movie. Do not, under any circumstances, let this movie approach within ten feet of your television.	0

The female lead was a terrible actress which made the whole movie mediocre. She was smiling too much when she first went in front of the cameras to talk about her daughter. This should have made the police suspect her. I would have been inconsolable in the identical situation. She seemed way calm for a mother who could not find her daughter. It was as if she did not want to even be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would have played the part better. And it would have made a lot more money for such a controversial, important subject. Everyone else was excellent. I don t know where the lead actress is but I hope she got some acting lessons.	0

They had an opportunity to make one of the best romantic tragedy mafia movies ever because they had the actors,the budget,and the story but the great director John Huston was too preoccupied trying to mellow out this missed classic.Strenuously trying to find black humor as often as possible which diluted the movie very much.And also they were so uncaring with details like sound and detailed action.Maybe it was the age of the director who passed away two years later.	0
Ascolia, in Ancient Greece, was a feast which the peasants of Attica celebrated in honor of Dionysus. They sacrificed a goat to him, and used its skin to make a football, which was filled with wine. The outside of the skin was made slippery with oil, and children tried hopping on it with one foot. The children falling over entertained the crowds, while the one who succeeded in maintaining an upright position to the end was considered the victor. The chief magistrate, or demarch, of a deme conducted the festival, while the deme paid for the expenses.	2

The supporting cast does little to buoy it up. Davis and Brent carry the picture. Though it s fairly predictable, it is also fairly entertaining. It s far from her best. But, especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre, it s not one of her worst, either.	0

I really wanted to like this movie. I absolutely love kenny hotz, and spenny rice has a charming side to him. Not that I like spenny at all. Spenny ruins this movie. He should of let kenny and his hot girlfriend pitch the movie. Anyways, it s pretty boring aside from a scene with Roger Ebert in it. There really isn t too many celebrities in this movie, and most don t seem to say more than one line. Overall this movie was disappointing. I would only suggest watching it if you got it with the season 1 DVD of kenny vs spenny  it comes for free on the 3rd disc . Regardless of this production, I am still very excited to check out The Papel Chase.	0

It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source. Here s a review without pretensions  Just when you think nothing is going to happen, it doesn t. Dress it up any way you like, this is a dull film, full of unengaging characters doing very little of interest. One to put on if you want to convince an impressionable emo chick that you re like, so deep, man. Not something to watch for your own pleasure though. Unless. You re. Pretentious.	0

Ending leaves you flatter than a pancake, with more loose ends than you could tie up in four sequels  that is, if you even cared about these wooden characters . MacLaine is the only real asset. That penultimate sequence in which the  Chicago hood  searches for the Sinatra character is laughable. The music in that sequence also is poor. And in the final scene when Martin s character removes his hat for the woman he called a  pig,  almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television screen.	0

It is soon discovered that Morty s spirit inhabits a wooden Indian in the cabin. The statue comes to life and the blood bath begins.

The movie looks great and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance. Most movies, when trying to subtle, don t call attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments, and weak special effects.

Metal insulator transitions refer to changes in the transport properties of a given material. Roughly speaking, materials can be classified as metals, allowing for good conductivity of electric charges, and as insulators, where conductivity of charges is quickly surpressed. In some materials, most notably semiconductors, changing their ambient conditions by, e.g. applying pressure or gate voltages, one can tune the transport properties from metallic to insulating or vice versa. These materials are thus useful as controlling devices in electric and electronic circuits.	2

He only gets third billing  behind Arthur Treacher   Virginia Field , but this was effectively David Niven s first starring role and he s charmingly silly as P. G. Wodehouse s dunderheaded Bertie Wooster, master  in name only  to Jeeves, that most unflappable of valets. As an adaptation, it s more like a watered down THE 39 STEPS than a true Wodehousian outing. And that s too bad since the interplay between Treacher   Niven isn t too far off the mark. Alas, the  B  movie mystery tropes   forced comedy grow wearisome even at a brief 57 minutes. Next year s follow up  STEP LIVELY, JEEVES  was even more off the mark, with no Bertie in sight and Jeeves  of all people   forced to play the goof.	0

Definitely an odd debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling all around him. Cecil grabs a phone book, looks up the name of a preacher, and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher s home and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart. That makes everything all better. Ahh...if only everything in life were that easy.

as an inspiring director myself, this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind. Shot with low end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for DOF. The editing is good acting decent, sound effects aren t too over the top. I would have give it a 7 for an indie film, but the story aren t that interesting. It s more on the drama side, character developments than a horror flick. It s not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out, or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy. honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50 s This movie is about a family who has a dry field, and that is just that.	0

Wow...sheer brilliance. Turning a thriller suspense horror into comedy. After watching this, I never laughed so hard at a horror movie before...a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that were just insanely developed   either not written in depth or too much depth. If you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog, messed up plot, useless scenes, wasted characters, bad sound and lousy development overall, then this is the one to watch.

When a small glob of space age silly putty lands on earth it soon begins consuming earthlings and putting on weight. The only part of this senseless drivel that I enjoyed was all the cool classic cars. This dog had so many holes it could be sliced and sold for swiss cheese. This thing actually made 20 million bucks  And McQueen s salary was 3K  All were vastly overpaid. The  monster  looked a lot like a large beanbag and the  teens  looked as though they could have children approaching their teen age years. And those blasts from the shotgun  sounded like a pellet rifle with a sound suppressor. The ending was pitifully trite  obviously the producers were leaving the door open for a sequel....and there were many. Thumbs down.	0

What an awful movie. I love monster flicks but I couldn t watch even half of the terrible acting, cardboard characters and abysmal special effects. There is nothing redeeming about this movie. The characters come from either an endless supply of suicidally stupid cannon fodder or else they are vacuous, uninspiring sock puppets. The plot is formulaic, cut and paste, standard science run amok drivel. Even the CGI is horrible. You know it s bad when you can t even depend on the movie to provide some good eye candy. No surprises here,just same old same old. This is truly one of the worst films ever made. Director Roger Corman should be hung from a lightpost so that children can use him as a pinata.	0

Don t even ask me why I watched this  The only excuse I can come up with that I was sick with Bronchitis and too weak to change the channel.    It s too terrible for words, the movie that is, not the Bronchitis. The acting is deplorable, Richard Grieco hams it up as a trigger happy, gun slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops. Nick Mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and Nancy Allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film. The script is dismal, peppered with clich  d lines,  Are you ready, Pardner   purrs Richard Grieco to every single one of his victims. Dire. Avoid.	0

In many ways, it is similar to Civics courses which are taught in many other countries, but the syllabus content is almost entirely related to local Hong Kong topics.	2

This is one of the two postapocalyptic fantasy movies that Albert Pyun made in 1993   and it s the bad one. Apparently all his energy went into  Nemesis  which was an entertaining non stop action movie, and had a much more expensive look.  Knights  is clunky and cheesy, a bottom of the barrel sci fi that too often resembles a video game  new opponents pop up all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible . The only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is Kathy Long  not a particularly attractive woman, but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine. As for Kris Kristofferson, considering his age at the time  58 , I hope his stunt double was well paid.   1 2 	0

Alcrete is a type of soil deposit, rich in aluminum. It is generally found in tropical regions, where the parent material is rapidly weathered because of high rainfall and high ambient temperatures. In these conditions, more mobile elements are leached out of the soil, leaving the relatively insoluble Al3  ions behind. A hard, nearly impermeable crust, called a duricrust, may form on or near the surface of such soils. Duricrusts of aluminum rich soils are called alcrete, or aluminocrete. Alcrete deposits with extremely high concentrations of aluminum are known as bauxite, the source of commercial aluminum ore.	2

Movie about a small town with equal numbers of Mormons and Baptists. New family moves in, cue the overwritten dialog, mediocre acting, green jello salad with shredded carrots, and every other  inside Mormon joke  known to man. Anyone outside the Mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this movie. Anyone inside the Mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there. You ll be much better off watching Hess s other movies  Napoleon Dynamite, etc..  than trying to sit through this one. The acting is mediocre.

Victorianism is the name given to the attitudes, art, and culture of the later two thirds of the 19th century.

Victorianism as a word is often specifically directed at Victorian morality. Victorianists refers to scholars who study Victorianism.	2

This is a genuinely horrible film. The plot  such as it is  is totally undecipherable.  I think it has something to do with blackmail, but I m not entirely certain.  Half of the dialogue consists of useless cliches. The other half is spoken by the various actors in such unintelligible imitations of  southern  accents that  thankfully  the words cannot be recognized. But the one true tragedy of the movie is that such a historic talent as Mary Tyler Moore apparently was in such dire financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in it.	0

The  First Suite in E flat major for Military Band   Op. 28, No. 1  is a cornerstone in the concert band repertoire. This piece, along with its sister piece,  Second Suite in F for Military Band , was written by the prominent British composer Gustav Holst. Aside from these two suites, Hammersmith and A Moorside Suite were his only band works. The First Suite, as it is informally called, was written for a full military band in 1909. During this time of band music, the repertoire was almost exclusively transcriptions from orchestral works. Ironically, Holst s First and Second Suites are two of the very few works for concert bands that have been transcribed for orchestra.	2

Uar,  for Chinese etymology see Hu     , was the self designation used by the dominant ethnicity in a confederation known to the Chinese as the Yanda     and to the west as the Hephthalites. It was the largest of one of the three ethnic components constituting the Hephthalite federation. Peoples with similar ethnicons had been present along the Silk Road for centuries, and several of the Central European family names actually derive from the names of such tribes. The Chinese classic Liang Zhigongtu describes them as originating in the Hua  state . Simokattes s term Uar is also sometimes written War or Var. The variation Hu    , is the name the Hephthalite polity used of themselves according to the Chinese classic Liang chih kung t u.	2

This show seemed to be kinda good. Kyra Sedgwick is an OK actress and I like police series, but somewhere in the production this program went awfully wrong.

I know they wanted her to be tough, but shes mean, stupid and a bad chief. The crimes are uninteresting and bland, and its just lame all the way. As stated above, I hate it....

I think Phillip Kaufman read the cliff s Notes version of the Kundera novel and then set about making this film. Okay, of course it won t have the punch of the original. Kundera s novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept, his ability to step in and out of stories he constructs. This film does not even try  The one dream sequence of Tereza s, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever. Also, and this is perhaps a lesser point, Daniel Day Lewis looks a lot like Ben Stiller in this  I know it s not really a valid complaint, but hey .

A Marine Expeditionary Brigade  MEB  is a unit of the United States Marine Corps, a Marine Air Ground Task Force  MAGTF  constructed around a reinforced infantry regiment, a composite Marine aircraft group, and a brigade service support group. The Marine expeditionary brigade  MEB , commanded by a general officer, is task organized to meet the requirements of a specific situation. It can function as part of a joint task force, as the lead echelon of the Marine expeditionary force  MEF , or alone. It varies in size and composition, and is larger than a Marine expeditionary unit but smaller than a MEF. The MEB is capable of conducting missions across the full range of military operations.	2

Take young, pretty people, put them in an exotic locale, stick in a few bad guys, have the two lead characters find romance after a couple of heavy breathing scenes, create the flimsiest of plots, then work out a happy ending for everybody  other than the three or four who get murdered, of course  That s the classic  and successful  format of the Harlequin Romance. It s not very good but then it s not very bad either, like most of the little yellow pocket books. And the location stuff in Budapest is especially interesting, even if they didn t use the wonderful old train station  designed by Gustave Eifel  or show the city s famous thermal baths.	0

Major Payne  is a film about a major who makes life a living Hell for his small group of boys in the marines. This film does not really have a lot to offer, but it provides several hilarious moments that are well worth a watch. Don t expect it to be a memorable film, however. Just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people. The confrontation between Major Payne and the chubby boy were hilarious, and that s really all I remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on Major Payne. Again, it is not a great film, and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter.	0

At least it s not full of sensless violence or fluff. It s also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline. This story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green.

Ouch  This one was a bit painful to sit through. It has a cute and amusing premise, but it all goes to hell from there. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and he does not disappoint in this one. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville turned in surprisingly decent performances. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, among others, played it way over the top. I know that s the way the parts were written, and it s hard to blame actors, when the script and director have them do such schlock. If you re going to have outrageous characters, that s OK, but you gotta have good material to make it work. It didn t here. Run away screaming from this movie if at all possible.	0

I read Rice s novel with interest, and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths. However, I was simply APPALLED at this disastrous adaptation. The casting was based merely on physical appearance, and not acting talent  with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher, who was neither blond haired, or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag . The cast s embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a French accent was hilarious, but not in an entertaining way. I found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe, and was surprised I made it to the end. A warning to fans of the novel   stay away from this one.	0

The acting was terrible, I felt sorry for the actors that they couldn t find something better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We were calling out the lines ahead of the actors, it was so predictable. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated, worse than a cartoon. Skip it.	0

The alternative table is a standard periodic table rotated counterclockwise and then mirrored across the vertical axis, hence like in many writing systems, the lower groups are to the left and the number increases to the right. Due to the rotation and the incorporation of the lanthanides and actinides into the main table, the Alternative Table is significantly longer vertically than the Standard Table. Its restricted width allows it to be read on line without having to scroll horizontally.	2

But overall it s just dull and excruciatingly not funny. A few simple jokes are repeated over and over again. It s clear that this movies only exists to squeeze the last few dollars out of the now trademarked Laurel and Hardy. The producers cannot have any real regard for their place in film history, or their talents. This is what offended me the most. Of course, my daughter liked it, so I m also a failure as a parent   	0

It s hard to praise this film much. The CGI for the dragon was well done, but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow. Also, the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious. I was amazed to see  Marcus Aurelius  in the acting credits, wondering what an ex Emperor of the Roman Empire was doing acting in this film  Like  Whoopie Goldberg  it must be an alias, and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker. The story might been interesting, but the acting is flat, and direction is tedious.

Pretty disappointing prequel to the first two films, it s got none of the suspense of the first nor the interest of the second. By concentrating on the guys who  run  the cube, it basically takes away any of the sense of tension inside the cube, as we simply don t care about the characters inside. Much of the film is simply boring, and it only becomes truly terrible with the introduction of the glass eyed superior and the green eyed crazy marine. After that, though, it just descends into over the top unintentional hilarity. The ending is fitting though, tying it back into the first one in an indirect way. The script is terrible, the acting mediocre at best, and the direction unimpressive. A much lesser follow up.	0

This movie is a prime example of squandering great resources in a film. You ve got future SNL and SCTV stars in their prime, such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken,Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty essentially making 70 minutes of coarse, uninspired fart and racist jokes. The concept of a network from the future subverting society could have really been taken to some interesting extremes, but instead right out the gate, makes a lame, juvenile proctology joke and stays in that vein of humor the whole way.Seek out the earlier and much more subversive and witty Groove Tube or the later, hilarious Kentucky Fried Movie. This movie is only for those who want to see a time capsule of bad 70 s sketch comedy movies.	0
When you look back at another bad Nightmare sequel like Freddy s Revenge, you have to at least give it some credit for trying something new.

These models are often proved insufficient, however  the Maxwell model does not describe creep, and the Kelvin Voigt model does not describe stress relaxation. SLS is the simplest model that predicts both phenomena.	2

This barely watchable film was a bit of an ordeal to sit through. None of the segments are good, but at least the first one was mildly amusing, and the middle one was somewhat imaginative. The final one was just plain brutal, and after sitting through two weak comedic shorts, the third one was truly painful to watch. Even by the low standards of a National Lampoon movie, this one seemed especially boring and joyless.	0

Ask the Dust  looked intriguing from the trailer, and we especially like all of the actors. Unfortunately, the movie was not compelling enough to be considered drama, and it wasn t funny enough to be a comedy. It practically seemed to satirize itself, and to no entertaining effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to get better, my wife and I walked out, valuing not having wasted any more time on such nonsense. It simply was not interesting, moving, funny nor artistic. It appears as though it were written, produced and directed by a high school kid  worse yet, it was such a shameful waste of otherwise extraordinarily talented actors, not to mention our time and money.	0

The Radiodrum is a musical instrument played in three dimensional space using two drumsticks. It was developed at Bell Labs in the 1980 s, originally to be a three dimensional substitute for the computer mouse. Currently it is used as a musical instrument similar to a MIDI controller in the sense that all the noise produced from it is programmed. The radiodrum works in a similar way to the theremin, which uses magnetic capacitance to locate the position of the drumsticks. The radiodrum was designed by Bob Boie, Max Mathews. and Andrew Schloss. The radiodrum has been rigged to visual effects, and even acoustic instruments like the piano.	2

Beauregard is the thick but lovable janitor at the Muppet Theater. He tries to be helpful, but his dimwitted efforts frequently result in disaster.

He has a characteristic blink and often turns to the camera and says,  Right.

I cant describe how terrible this movie is. Am i the only one here who finds the way its animated totaly disgusting  The Men of Rohan look 100  fake with their poorly colored hair, that doesnt even come close to matching what the actors look like. The orcs looked terrible. Why does gandalf walk with a bad limp  Why cant they pronounce things correctly  Saruman isnt Aruman. There were other what sounded like terrible pronounciation sp  of Tolkiens characters. All and all im glad the studio who made this pulled the plug out from the sequal, it was just a terrible terrible adaptaion. Go watch the hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon of Tolkiens work. Hell, even the cartoon version of ROTK is better then this dribble. 2 10	0

Sorry. Someone has to say it. This really is was a dull movie. Worthy perhaps, but dull nonetheless. I nearly cried with boredom when watching it. The acting is pretty dire, the story drawn out and predictable, the score and camera work totally standard and unexciting. It s one of those movies you are not allowed to hate  becase it is about disabled people  but hate it I suspect nearly everyone does. It is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie. I suppose they too are not allowed to be objective. This was made to win awards   which I remember it duly did. But it was neither interesting nor entertaining. I haven t seen the play so cannot compare.	0

It is not often I watch a film that is as dreadful as this one. I continued to watch, every minute hoping that this was intended as a joke only to find it was meant to be taken seriously. Well, as seriously as this genre requests. The acting was disgraceful and the situations horribly contrived and clich  d. If a film was made in 1920  for example  and had the quality of Hide   Seek  Cord  in its direction we would think that cinema back then was naive. As it happens, this film was made in 2000 and I have yet to see a film from the silent era that has as little charm as this one. Definitely not for the serious movie goer.  Not worth a rating 	0

This movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel complete. The one thing people have forgotten is the fact that the reason the original won such acclaim, was strictly do to the fact that it was supposed to make you feel incomplete. This movie makes me want to go to the washroom. I am not a negative type of guy, but man the acting in this flick is.... no comment. The plot was a bad reflection of the life of Carlito Brigante and I am sorry to have had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this flick. I still love the original and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my opinion about it.	0

The only two decent things in this movie are both attached to gorgeous Stella Stevens and one spends the entire program hoping she ll fall out of one of those skimpy tops she wears. Many great shots of mid 70s Las Vegas  when it was still a cool place to visit  and the fashions of the day are good for a giggle as well. Otherwise, one big yawn. The Rhino dvd has a very good widescreen transfer but even at under 10 bucks it still ain t worth it in my humble opinion.	0

The best that I can say about this film is that it was mildly amusing at times, and that it was an adequate time killer. Unfortunately, this film is also so annoying that I wanted to slap these characters around. This is the kind of film that is so sweet, it hurts your teeth. The intentions were good, I suppose, but things get awfully tiresome when the dialogue is SO nauseating. When the two leads aren t together on screen, this really isn t bad at all, but be afraid during those frequent moments when the loving couple starts talking to one another.	0

Having read another review, I thought this movie would actually be good. I do enjoy the  B  movies, but this couldn t even be classed as such. The photography is probably the only half way decent thing in the movie. But the editing left much to be desired. It was very choppy and staccato. Whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job. The music was awful, specially anything atmospheric or scene setting. If the acting had been better, they could have pulled the movie off. Unfortunately, I ve seen better acting in porn flicks. If you want to see a  B  vampire movie, check out  Blood Ties . You ll be much more entertained.	0

The secret is...this movie blows. Sorry, but it just did.     SPOILER     In this bad riff on I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and SCREAM, Beth, played admirably by Dorie Barton, joins several friends on a Spring Break trip. The group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation. Then, the deaths begin. First one then another then another of the friends is murdered, leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results. One note, Dorie Barton is the poor man s Reese Witherspoon  she looks like Reese, acts like Reese and could pass for Reese in a police lineup. Maybe that s how they cast her  Anyhoo, decent cinematography and fair acting could not quite make up for bad dialog and terrible writing.	0
Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A love biangle,  sorry for the poetical license, but is not a triangle   an interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes OK, the picture looks crowded and narrow sighted. The sound needs more attention  it usually does in Romanian movies , the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and is not helping the action. About the acting... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. The others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer. The acting is poetical when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetical. It s a picture for adults, told by the children. Bother only if extremely curious.	0
