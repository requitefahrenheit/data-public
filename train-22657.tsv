ll love it and probably want to see it twice .	1
re in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish	1
s a talking head documentary , but a great one .	1
s a very entertaining , thought provoking film with a simple message	1
s an interesting effort   particularly for JFK conspiracy nuts  	1
s as hard to classify as it is hard to resist	1
s certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community .	1
s lots of cool stuff packed into ESPN  s Ultimate X.	1
s sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong	1
s so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller	1
s sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels	1
 A   devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid Holocaust drama .	1
 Reaches   wholly believable and heart wrenching depths of despair .	1
 Sports   admirable energy , full bodied characterizations and narrative urgency	1
 Woo  s   most resonant film since The Killer .	1
 faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty	1
,    Derrida is an undeniably fascinating and playful fellow .	1
, Big Trouble could be considered a funny little film .	1
, Like Mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud	1
, Notorious C.H.O. hits all the verbal marks it should .	1
, Thirteen Conversations About One Thing is a small gem .	1
,   Scratch   is a pretty decent little documentary .	1
, but it works under the direction of Kevin Reynolds .	1
, it  s goofy   if not entirely wholesome   fun	1
, really , really good things can come in enormous packages	1
, still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema	1
, the film operates nicely off the element of surprise ,	1
, the production works more often than it does n t .	1
, the trip there is a great deal of fun .	1
, then look no further , because here it is .	1
, this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate .	1
, to find a place among the studio  s animated classics	1
, very well told with an appropriate minimum of means .	1
, with some real shocks in store for unwary viewers .	1
... begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully .	1

demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself	1
doc that is n t trying simply to out shock , out outrage or out depress its potential audience  	1
enough originality in   Life   to distance it from the pack of paint by number romantic comedies	1
explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of Truffaut	1

from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel	1

has n t lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film	1

involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light	1
is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies	1
is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later .	1
is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer	1
is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string .	1
is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy	1
is n t a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun ,	1
is n t nearly as graphic but much more powerful , brutally shocking and difficult to watch	1
is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema	1
is right at home in this French shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role .	1
is so rich with period minutiae it  s like dying and going to celluloid heaven .	1
is still quite good natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two .	1
is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies .	1
is that its dying , in this shower of black and white psychedelia , is quite beautiful .	1
is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd pleasing goals it sets for itself .	1
it  s so fascinating you wo n t be able to look away for a second .	1
it  s still a good yarn    which is nothing to sneeze at these days .	1
it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience	1
it will do so in a way that does n t make you feel like a sucker	1
laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness	1
laughs    sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure ,	1

melodrama   gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas   with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements	1

succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that  s simultaneously painful and refreshing .	1
successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling .	1
sustain the buoyant energy level of the film  s city beginnings into its country conclusion  	1
tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet	1
that  s every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as Grant  s two best films	1
that  s refreshing after the phoniness of female bonding pictures like Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood	1
that Krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film  s thoroughly winning tone	1
that both thrills the eye and , in its over the top way , touches the heart .	1
that deftly , gradually reveals a real human soul buried beneath a spellbinding serpent  s smirk	1
that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy	1
that embraces its old fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original	1
that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right	1
that keeps Dickens evergreen   the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions	1
that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theatre	1

the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes	1
the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies I  ve had in a while	1
the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche .	1
the type of film about growing up that we do n t see often enough these days	1
this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that French realism	1
three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations	1
to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside	1
to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings	1
to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human scale characters that suck the audience in	1
to make a splash even greater than Arnold Schwarzenegger , Jean Claud Van Damme or Steven Segal	1
to make its subject interesting to those who are n t part of its supposed target audience	1
to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart	1
to make the most sincere and artful movie in which Adam Sandler will probably ever appear	1
to recommend SECRETARY , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal	1
to the courage of New York  s finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief	1
turns out to be significantly different   and better   than most films with this theme	1
uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it  s in danger of going wrong	1
until the film is well under way    and yet it  s hard to stop watching	1
us a slice of life that  s very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable	1
us to remember that life  s ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced	1
uses Grant  s own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos	1
uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life	1
visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet	1
we  re wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why	1
what made old time B movies good bad that makes Eight Legged Freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion	1
when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned	1
which pokes fun at the price of popularity and small town pretension in the Lone Star State	1
who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first rate  	1
whose view of America , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep	1
will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach .	1
with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast	1
with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera	1
with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it	1
with muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch	1
with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count	1
would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed   The French Lieutenant  s Woman	1

is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many	1
is a shame that more wo n t get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet   Evelyn .	1

look at morality , family , and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage	1
manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human scale characters that suck the audience in .	1

of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes	1
offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring do puts the X into the games	1
on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the Inuit people	1
one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies I  ve had in a while	1
over the bombastic self glorification of other feel good fiascos like Antwone Fisher or The Emperor  s Club any time	1

presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet .	1
reacting to it   feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled	1
received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film	1
recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it .	1
remains aloft not on its own self referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of Tim Allen	1
rewritten , and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love	1
seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film	1
shows a level of young , Black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated .	1
shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits .	1
shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them .	1
shows us a slice of life that  s very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable .	1
so , hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons .	1
somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart	1
strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss	1
succeeds due to its rapid fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it ca n t be dismissed as mindless	1
that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field	1
the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his    so perfect for a ballplayer	1
the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of ... emotional recovery	1

this engaging film about two men who discover what William James once called   the gift of tears	1
though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more .	1
to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times	1
to inject her pure fantasy character , Melanie Carmichael , with a massive infusion of old fashioned Hollywood magic	1
to present an unflinching look at one man  s downfall , brought about by his lack of self awareness	1
touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by Rachel Griffiths .	1
unfolds as Sand  s masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form .	1
van der Groen , described as   Belgium  s national treasure ,   is especially terrific as Pauline	1
walked away from this new version of E.T. just as I hoped I would    with moist eyes	1
who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them	1
who have used the emigre experience to explore same sex culture in ways that elude the more nationally settled	1
with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind  s liberating ability	1
would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed   The French Lieutenant  s Woman .  	1
would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art .	1
you  d do well to check this one out because it  s straight up Twin Peaks action ...	1
you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st Century	1
young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale  s tale	1

ThisIsUs is my new favorite show... why did it take so long for someone to think of this show      nbc	1
  succeeds due to its rapid fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it ca n t be dismissed as mindless .	1
s a clear eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties	1
s a fine , old fashioned movie movie , which is to say it  s unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance	1
s a part of us that can not help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something	1
s a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it .	1
s a sweet , laugh a minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth .	1
s a treat watching Shaw , a British stage icon , melting under the heat of Phocion  s attentions .	1
s equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it  s started	1
s fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom	1
s good , hard edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street smart	1
s packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history .	1
 Gosling  s   combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character .	1
 Haynes     homage to such films as    All That Heaven Allows    and    Imitation of Life	1

, I  m going to recommend SECRETARY , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal	1
, Time Out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything I have seen in an American film .	1
, it  s Kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers .	1
, it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human scale characters that suck the audience in .	1
, letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be .	1
, pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime .	1
, the basic plot of    Lilo    could have been pulled from a tear stained vintage Shirley Temple script .	1
, they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an Asian landscape painting .	1
, this retooled Machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd pleasing goals it sets for itself .	1
, you come to believe that Nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals .	1
... is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money oriented the record industry really is .	1

Asks what truth can be discerned from non firsthand experience , and specifically questions cinema  s capability for recording truth .	1
Astonishingly skillful and moving ... it could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one .	1
Beautifully shot , delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances , it  s a lyrical endeavour .	1
Beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart .	1

FantasticBeasts is an excellent movie, in my opinion, but I still can t wait for  cinemasins to sin the sh t out of it	1
ll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture	1
s   quite a bit of heart , as you would expect from the directors of The Little Mermaid and Aladdin .	1
s Quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his    so perfect for a ballplayer	1
s no surprise that as a director Washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer Derek Luke .	1
s refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original	1
s the perfect star vehicle for Grant , allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling , tongue tied screen persona	1
s truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible .	1
 Haneke   steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology .	1
, About a Boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater .	1
, Scotland , PA would be forgettable if it were n t such a clever adaptation of the bard  s tragic play .	1
, it delivers the same message as Jiri Menzel  s Closely Watched Trains and Danis Tanovic  s No Man  s Land .	1
, there is no doubt that Krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film  s thoroughly winning tone .	1
... does full honor to Miyazaki  s teeming and often unsettling landscape , and to the conflicted complexity of his characters .	1

a technically superb film , shining with all the usual Spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top notch creative team	1
a timely , tongue in cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing	1
above its oh so Hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old fashioned escapism	1
accomplished Oscar winners Susan Sarandon , Dustin Hoffman and Holly Hunter , yet newcomer Ellen Pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb	1
an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty    and as emotionally grand as life .	1
an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci fi thriller .	1
anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother daughter pair	1
are both excellent , in the kind of low key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk .	1
are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy .	1
are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field	1
as the enigmatic Mika and Anna Mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of Chabrol  s most intense psychological mysteries	1
by the better film  s ability to make its subject interesting to those who are n t part of its supposed target audience	1
celebrates the group  s playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what Hibiscus grandly called his   angels of light	1
exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they do n t have , and how this gets us in trouble	1

impressed by how many tit for tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an American Russian Armageddon	1
is Serry  s ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context	1
is a masterpiece of nuance and characterization , marred only by an inexplicable , utterly distracting blunder at the very end .	1
is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the American underground .	1
is awe and affection    and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude .	1
is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times .	1
is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth .	1
is n t a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work .	1
is n t that the picture is unfamiliar , but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems .	1
is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy .	1
is surely everything its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation .	1
it  s a big , comforting jar of Marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness	1
